> [!TIP] Buy individual fillets
- 6 oz fillets = perfect GLP-1 portion.
- No leftovers to manage, fresh every time.
- Or meal prep: cook 4 fillets Sunday, reheat 2-3 minutes.

## Why this works
Heavy meat (beef, pork) can sit wrong on low-appetite GLP-1 days. Salmon is lighter, flaky, easy to digest, and packed with omega-3s (anti-inflammatory).

## Recipe
**Ingredients (per 6 oz fillet):**
- 6 oz salmon fillet (skin on or off - your preference)
- 1 tbsp olive oil or melted butter
- Salt + pepper to taste
- 1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
- 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice (optional)
- 1 tsp dried herbs (dill, parsley, or lemon pepper)

**Directions:**
1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. Line baking sheet with foil or parchment paper.
3. Place salmon on sheet, skin-side down if skin on.
4. Brush with oil/butter, season with salt + pepper.
5. Add minced garlic, lemon juice, herbs if using.
6. Bake 12-18 minutes (thinner fillets = less time, thicker = more).
7. Done when fish flakes easily with fork (internal 145°F).
8. Serve immediately or store in fridge 3-4 days.

## Seasoning Variations

### Classic Lemon Dill
- Olive oil + lemon juice + dried dill + garlic
- Fresh and bright flavor

### Garlic Butter
- Melt butter + minced garlic + parsley
- Rich comfort flavor

### Maple Glaze Salmon
- Olive oil + 1 tbsp maple syrup + soy sauce + ginger
- Sweet + savory combination

### Cajun Salmon
- Olive oil + cajun seasoning blend
- Spicy kick if you can handle it

### Minimalist
- Just salt + pepper
- Sometimes least is best for sensitive stomach

## Serving Ideas
- **Pure:** Just salmon + fork (3-4 bites = meal).
- **With greens:** Side of steamed broccoli or asparagus.
- **With starch:** Small portion quinoa or rice (1/2 cup = 100 cal).
- **Salad base:** Flake salmon onto mixed greens (protein salad).

## Reheating (Meal Prep)
- **Oven:** 325°F for 8-10 minutes (best texture).
- **Microwave:** 60-90 seconds (slightly overcooked texture).
- **Cold:** Eat cold in salad (totally fine).

> [!WARNING] Overcooking
- Salmon goes from perfect to dry in 2 minutes.
- 12 minutes for standard fillet usually good.
- Check early - flake test beats timer.

> [!NOTE] Wild vs Farmed
- **Wild salmon:** More omega-3s, leaner, pricier.
- **Farmed salmon:** Slightly less omega-3s, higher calories, cheaper.
- Both good. Buy what fits your budget.

> [!BONUS] Air Fryer Option
- Air fry at 375°F for 8-10 minutes.
- Crispy exterior, flaky interior.
- Faster than oven, good for weeknights.

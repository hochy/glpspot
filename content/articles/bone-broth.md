> [!TIP] Store in 1-cup portions
- Pour into mason jars or freezer bags in 1-cup portions.
- Thaw in fridge overnight or microwave from frozen.

## Why this works
GLP-1 low-appetite days happen. Bone broth is the ultimate backup plan: liquid protein, electrolytes, minimal chewing, easy on stomach.

## The Reality Check
- **Homemade (12-24 hours cook time):** ~15g protein/cup, rich collagen.
- **Store-bought (instant):** 6-10g protein/cup, faster, less collagen.
- Both are valid. Use what fits your life.

## Option 1: Homemade (Best quality)
**Ingredients:**
- 2-3 lbs beef bones or chicken carcass (ask butcher for "soup bones")
- 1 onion, quartered
- 2 carrots, roughly chopped
- 2 celery stalks, roughly chopped
- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar (helps extract nutrients)
- Salt + pepper to taste
- 1 bay leaf (optional)
- 1 sprig thyme or rosemary (optional)

**Directions:**
1. Roast bones at 400°F for 30 minutes (adds flavor).
2. Transfer to large pot. Cover bones with water (at least 2 inches above).
3. Add vinegar + vegetables + herbs + salt.
4. Bring to boil, then reduce to lowest possible simmer.
5. Cook minimum 12 hours, ideally 24 hours.
6. Strain through fine mesh sieve. Store in 1-cup portions.
7. Refrigerate up to 1 week, freeze up to 6 months.

## Option 2: Store-Bought Quickest (Instant)
**Look for:**
- "Bone broth" (not stock/broth)
- 10g+ protein per cup
- Organic/grass-fed if possible

**Brands to try:**
- Kettle & Fire
- Bonafide Provisions
- Epic Provisions
- Costco has decent options in bulk

## Serving Ideas
- **Pure:** Heat and sip (cup of soup).
- **With egg ribbons:** Beat egg + slowly pour into hot broth while whisking. Egg ribbons form. Adds 6g more protein.
- **With shredded chicken:** Add 2-3 oz cooked chicken. Adds 20-25g protein (makes it a meal).
- **With spinach:** Stir in fresh spinach. It wilts instantly, adds nutrients.

## When to Drink Bone Broth
- Morning of (if you know it'll be a low-appetite day)
- Throughout day when food feels impossible
- Post-workout before you can stomach real food

> [!WARNING] Sodium caution
- Store-bought = very high sodium sometimes.
- Drink extra water to balance.
- If on blood pressure meds, check with doctor.

> [!NOTE] Beef vs Chicken
- Beef broth: Richer flavor, more collagen.
- Chicken broth: Lighter, familiar comfort food taste.
- Both work. Use what you'll actually drink.

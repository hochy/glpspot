> [!TIP] Use panko breadcrumbs
- Panko = lighter, crispier breading than traditional breadcrumbs
- Less absorbent = stays crisp, doesn't get soggy fast
- Baked not fried = same satisfaction, 50% fewer calories

## Why This Works

**Lightening chicken parmesan:**
- **Restaurant version:** Fried, heavy breading, 800-1000 cal
- **Lightened version:** Baked or pan-seared, moderate breading, 400-450 cal
- **Same comfort:** Cheesy, satisfying, feels like "real meal"

**GLP-1 portion reality:**
- Restaurant: Half chicken breast = still 400-500 cal (plus pasta)
- This recipe: Half chicken breast = 30g protein, 400-450 cal (legitimate meal)
- No bread basket needed (appetite won't accommodate anyway)

## Base Recipe

**Ingredients (2 servings):**

**Chicken:**
- 2 chicken breasts, pounded to even thickness (~8 oz each, 45g protein total)
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 2 tbsp parmesan cheese, grated
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp dried Italian herbs (oregano, basil)
- Salt + pepper
- 1 egg + 1 tbsp milk (or buttermilk)
- 2 tbsp olive oil (for cooking)

**Topping:**
- 1/2 cup marinara sauce (low-sodium preferred)
- 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded (part-skim = fewer calories)

**Optional side (keep small):**
- 1 cup steamed broccoli or zucchini noodles (not full pasta)

**Directions:**
1. **Prep chicken:** Pound breasts to even 1/2 inch thickness (tender + even cooking).
2. **Breading stations:**
   - Station 1: Egg + milk whisked
   - Station 2: Panko + parmesan + garlic powder + herbs + salt + pepper
3. **Dredge chicken:** Dip in egg, press into breading (both sides).
4. **Cook (choose method):**
   - **Pan-sear + bake (recommended):** Heat oil, sear 3-4 min per side (golden crust), transfer to baking sheet.
   - **Oven-bake:** Baking sheet with wire rack, 400°F for 20-25 min.
5. **Add topping:** Spoon marinara on chicken, sprinkle mozzarella.
6. **Melt cheese:** Return to oven 3-5 min until bubbly.
7. **Serve** immediately with optional vegetables.

## Cooking Methods

### Pan-Sear + Bake (Best Texture)

**Why it works:**
- Searing creates crisp crust (better than pure baking)
- Fin baking cooks through without over-browning
- Best of both: crispy crust, fully cooked

**Method:**
- Heat oil in skillet (medium-high).
- Sear chicken 3-4 min per side (golden).
- Transfer to baking sheet (wire rack ideal for airflow).
- Add sauce + cheese directly on chicken.
- Bake 10 min at 400°F to melt cheese.

### Pure Oven-Bake (Simpler)

**Method:**
- Preheat 400°F.
- Place dredged chicken directly on baking sheet (preferably with wire rack).
- Bake 20-25 min until internal 165°F.
- Add sauce + cheese, bake additional 3-5 min.

**Pros/cons:**
- Simpler one-pan method
- Less crispy than seared version
- Still tasty, lighter effort

### Air Fryer (Faster, Crisp)

**Method:**
- Preheat air fryer 375°F.
- Place dredged chicken in basket (may need 2 batches).
- Cook 12-15 min, flip halfway.
- Add sauce + cheese, cook final 2-3 min.

**Note:**
- May need to cook one chicken breast at a time (size constraints)
- Very crispy exterior

## Variations

### Classic Marinara
- Traditional marinara + mozzarella
- Fresh basil on top
- Served over zucchini noodles (not full pasta)

### Pesto Parmesan
- Replace marinara with pesto
- Mozzarella still on top
- Pesto provides healthy fats + flavor

### Spicy Arrabbiata
- Add red pepper flakes to breading
- Use spicy marinara or add chili flakes to sauce
- Hot pepper mozzarella (optional)

### Florentine (Spinach)
- Sauté chopped spinach in oil first
- Use spinach in sauce or layer between chicken + cheese
- Iron boost from spinach

## Serving Suggestions

**As complete meal (400-450 cal):**
- **Chicken + vegetables:** Steamed broccoli, roasted asparagus, or zucchini noodles
- **No pasta needed:** Chicken + vegetables = legitimate GLP-1 portion

**With small starch (500-600 cal):**
- **Zucchini noodles:** 1 cup zucchini spirals (30 cal)
- **Small side of pasta:** 1/2 cup cooked pasta (100-120 cal)
- **Sliced baguette:** 1 slice (80-100 cal)

**Sauce ratio:**
- **Less is more:** 2-3 tbsp sauce per chicken (not drowning it)
- **Calories hidden in sauce:** Check labels - some marinara is 120 cal per 1/4 cup!

## Meal Prep

**Freezing:**
- Cooked chicken parmesan freezes well (3 months).
- Cool completely before freezing.
- Reheat from frozen: Microwave 3-4 min, then oven bake 10 min at 350°F (re-crisp).

**Reheating from fridge:**
- **Microwave:** 2 min (texture softens, less crisp).
- **Oven:** 15 min at 350°F (re-crisps crust best).
- **Air fryer:** 5-7 min at 350°F (fast, re-crisps well).

**Pre-ahead:**
- Pound and bread chicken day before.
- Store in fridge, cook next day (breading stays crisp if not left too long).

## Breading Variations

| Breading Type | Texture | Calories |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| **Panko (recommended)** | Light, crispy | 60 cal per 1/4 cup |
| Traditional breadcrumbs | Heavier, denser | 80 cal per 1/4 cup |
| Pork rind crumbs (keto option) | Similar to panko | 5g protein per 1/4 cup, 60 cal |
- No-breading: Just seasoned + seared (lightest option, 50 fewer calories) |

## Troubleshooting

**Breading falls off:**
- Press firmly into breading (don't just coat surface).
- Let dredged chicken sit 5 min before cooking (helps coating set).
- Don't flip too early in pan-sear (wait for crust to form).

**Chicken undercooked:**
- Always check internal temp (165°F minimum).
- Thicker breasts need longer time.
- Cut into thick part near bone if unsure.

**Sauce too watery:**
- Simmer sauce in pan first (reduces, concentrates flavor).
- Or bake chicken uncovered first, add sauce last 5-10 min.
- Watery sauce = soggy chicken.

> [!WARNING] Watch cheese calories
- Mozzarella adds 150-200 cal per 1/2 cup
- Full-fat part-skim is best compromise (flavor without excessive calories)
- Fat-free mozzarella melts poorly, tastes rubbery (avoid)

> [!NOTE] Chicken breasts vary in size
- Supermarket breasts: 6-8 oz typical
- Organic/perk breasts: sometimes 4-6 oz (smaller portions)
- Recipe assumes ~8 oz breasts - adjust if smaller
- Two 6 oz breasts = 36g protein per serving (~25% less)

> [!BONUS] Vegetarian option
- Replace chicken with: Portobello mushrooms (less protein, 8g per cup) OR eggplant slices (3-6g protein per cup)
- Use same breading + cooking method
- Vegetarian version: ~8-15g protein per serving (add side protein for complete meal)

# Common GLP-1 Start-Up Mistakes to Avoid

Starting a GLP-1 medication is exciting — the potential for weight change, improved health, better blood sugar control. But those first weeks are also when mistakes happen most often.

You don't have to be perfect. But avoiding these common pitfalls makes your journey smoother and results better.

## Mistake #1: Stopping Regular Meals Altogether

**The mistake:** "I'm not hungry, so I won't eat... at all."

**Why it's a problem:**
- Your body still needs protein (muscle maintenance doesn't pause)
- Blood sugar can crash dangerously (especially if you're diabetic on Metformin)
- Your metabolism slows down, making weight loss harder
- Energy crashes, irritability, brain fog

**What to do instead:**
- Eat small, protein-focused meals every 3-4 hours
- Even if you're not hungry: 1-2 eggs, some yogurt, a protein shake
- Consistent eating keeps your metabolism running

## Mistake #2: Drinking Enough Calories in Liquids

**The mistake:** "I'll have my calories in frappes/milkshakes/iced lattes since my appetite is down for food."

**Why it's a problem:**
- Liquid calories don't trigger satiety hormones the way solid food does
- You can still consume substantial calories without feeling satisfied
- Sugar and caffeine can worsen GLP-1 side effects (nausea, jitters)
- You lose the dietary structure

**What to do instead:**
- Drink water, unsweetened tea, or black coffee
- If you enjoy fancy drinks, know: they're treats, not meals
- Track if you're using them to replace meals (you're not)
- Opt for protein shakes when you need liquid nutrition

## Mistake #3: Ignoring Side Effects

**The mistake:** "Nausea, fatigue, constipation... these are just part of it. I'll push through."

**It's not true.** Most common GLP-1 side effects are manageable with simple strategies:

**Nausea:**
- Take medication at night instead of morning
- Drink warm water (not cold) immediately after dose
- Avoid strong-smelling foods (triggers nausea)
- Eat small, frequent meals instead of big ones

**Fatigue:**
- Check protein intake (low protein = low energy)
- Get morning light exposure (15-30 min outside)
- B-complex vitamin if approved by your doctor
- Earlier bedtime helps

**Constipation:**
- More fiber (vegetables, fruits, chia seeds, psyllium)
- More water (dehydration worsens constipation)
- Gentle movement after meals (walks help)
- Consider magnesium supplement if doctor approves

**Address symptoms early.** Don't "tough it out" unnecessarily.

## Mistake #4: Stopping When You Feel "Good Enough"

**The mistake:** "I've lost 30 lbs and my blood sugar is normal. I don't need this anymore."

**Reality:** 
- Weight loss often plateaus after initial phase
- Your body has adapted to the dose
- Stopping cold = rapid weight regain is very common (studies show up to 66%)
- GLP-1 medications continue providing benefits you might not notice

**What to do:**
- Discuss dose reduction or stopping with your doctor
- If they approve it, do it gradually (don't stop cold turkey)
- Keep protein and healthy habits you've built
- Stay in touch with weight and blood sugar metrics

## Mistake #5: Not Tracking Protein

**You can't manage what you don't track.**

A common GLP-1 pattern: weight loss happens fast initially, then slows or stalls. People feel frustrated. What often changed?

**Protein dropped.**

- You were eating a lot of protein initially (because you were hungry)
- As appetite decreased, you ate less protein
- Muscle maintenance slowed
- Metabolism dropped
- Weight loss stalled

**What to do:**
- Aim for 120-150g protein daily (adjust based on weight/height/sex)
- Track what you're eating (no fancy app required - simple checklist works)
- At breakfast: make protein the focus
- Snack on protein: yogurt, eggs, jerky, protein shakes, protein bars

When protein is consistent, you maintain muscle even with reduced calories. That's the key.

## Mistake #6: Thinking GLP-1 is a "Fix-All"

**GLP-1 medications help with:**
- Appetite reduction
- Satiety signals
- Weight support
- Blood sugar control

**They don't fix:**
- Emotional eating
- Habits you've built over decades
- Movement and exercise
- Sleep
- Stress management
- Relationship with food

**What you still need:**
- Protein (most important!)
- Regular movement (doesn't have to be a gym membership)
- Good sleep (7-9 hours)
- Stress management
- Support - whether it's a community, friends, or healthcare team

**GLP-1 is a tool.** One tool among many. Don't expect it to handle everything that took decades to create.

## Mistake #7: Skipping Check-Ins with Your Doctor

**The mistake:** "I've been doing fine, so I don't need appointments."

**What gets missed:**
- Dose adjustments might be needed (most people titrate up)
- Side effects might need intervention or different medication timing
- Other medications (for blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) might need adjustment as weight changes
- Labs should be checked periodically (HbA1c, lipid panel, kidney function, etc.)

**Recommended schedule:**
- Initial: Every 1-3 months during titration
- Then: Every 3-6 months once stable
- Your specific situation may vary — defer to your doctor

Stay engaged with your healthcare team.

**Perfect path** isn't about avoiding every mistake. It's about learning from them quickly and adjusting.

**You've got this.** And when you don't? That's okay too. Reset, refocus, continue.

*The foundation of success on GLP-1 is simple: protein first, consistent habits, realistic expectations, self-compassion. Anything else is noise.*

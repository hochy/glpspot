> [!TIP] Texture hack
- Blend cottage cheese for 30 seconds = Greek yogurt consistency.
- Or eat whole curds for more texture/satiety.

## Why this works
Cottage cheese is higher in casein (slow-digesting) than whey. It keeps you full longer. Less sweet than yogurt, more neutral flavor.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup low-fat cottage cheese (25g protein)
- 1/2 cup berries or tomatoes (fruit vs savory)
- Optional: 1 tbsp honey (if fruit) or hot sauce (if savory)
- Optional: Sprinkle of nuts/seeds

## Directions
1. Spoon cottage cheese into a bowl.
2. Top with berries OR tomatoes (pick one, don't mix).
3. Sweet or savory add-on (honey OR hot sauce).
4. Add nuts/seeds if you need calories.
5. Eat.

## Sweet Version
- Cottage cheese + berries + sprinkle of cinnamon.
- Optional: 1 tsp honey or stevia.
- Good for breakfast.

## Savory Version
- Cottage cheese + diced tomatoes + salt + pepper.
- Optional: Hot sauce, diced cucumber, fresh herbs.
- Good for lunch/snack.

## Texture Variations
- **As-is:** Curd texture, slightly bumpy. Some people love it, some don't.
- **Blended:** 30 seconds in blender = smooth like Greek yogurt.
- **Whipped:** Fork whip for fluffiness (less smooth).

> [!WARNING] Sodium warning
- Some cottage cheese brands are very high in sodium.
- Look for "low sodium" or "no salt added" versions if sensitive.

> [!NOTE] Greek yogurt vs cottage cheese
- Greek yogurt: More calcium, sweeter flavor, whey-dominant (faster digestion).
- Cottage cheese: Higher casein (slower digestion), savory option, same protein.

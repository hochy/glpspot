> [!TIP] Buy frozen edamame
- Fresh edamame requires shucking (takes 15 min)
- Frozen: Already shelled OR in pods (ready to steam)
- Keep a bag in freezer = always protein-ready snack

## Why This Works

**Edamame advantages:**
- **Plant protein:** 18g per cup (complete protein profile)
- **Fiber-high:** 8-10g fiber (satiating, digestion friendly)
- **No cooking:** Steam 5 min, season, eat
- **Versatile seasoning:** Sweet, salty, spicy all work
- **Portable:** Cold edamame works as office/packed snack

**GLP-1 specific:**
- 1 cup = substantial snack (18g protein)
- If appetite very low: 1/2 cup = 9g protein (still legit)
- Low cooking effort = easier on low-energy days

## Basic Preparation

**Ingredients (per serving):**
- 1 cup edamame (shelled OR in pods)
- Salt to taste (sea salt preferred)
- Optional: Black pepper, garlic powder, citrus

**Directions:**
1. **Cook edamame** (choose method):
   - **Steam:** Place in steamer basket, steam 5 min.
   - **Boil:** Place pods in boiling water 3-4 min, drain.
   - **Microwave:** Place in microwave-safe bowl, add 2 tbsp water, cover (vented), microwave 3 min.
2. **Season:** Sprinkle salt + optional pepper/garlic powder.
3. **Cool slightly** or eat immediately.
## Seasoning Variations

**Salt + Garlic Powder (Simplest)**
- Sea salt + 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- Classic savory flavor

**Soy Sauce + Ginger**
- 1 tbsp soy sauce + 1/4 tsp fresh ginger + sesame seeds
- Asian-style flavor

**Spicy Sriracha**
- Soy sauce + Sriracha to taste
- Sweet-hothead spice

**Lemon + Sea Salt**
- Fresh lemon juice + sea salt
- Fresh, brighter flavor

**Truffle Oil + Salt**
- 1 tsp truffle oil + sea salt
- Fancy but easy

**Sweet-Salty (Less Common but Works)**
- Sea salt + honey drizzle + chili flakes
- Surprisingly good combo

## Serving Scenarios

**As snack:**
- **1 cup edamame:** 18g protein, 190 cal (solid snack)
- **1/2 cup edamame:** 9g protein, 95 cal (smaller snack)
- **With dip:** Hummus or Greek yogurt dip (extra protein)

**With meal:**
- **Side protein:** Add to main meal for extra 18g protein
- **Stir-fry base:** Toss with veggies + soy sauce (meal prep)
- **Salad topping:** Shelled, mixed into green salad

**As vegetarian main protein:**
- **Edamame + rice:** 18g protein + starch = complete meal concept
- **Edamame + quinoa:** 18g protein + more protein (18+8g = 26g total)

## Shelled vs. In-Pod

| Preparation | Pros | Cons | Serving Size |
|-------------|------|------|-------------|
| **Shelled edamame** | Ready to eat, no shucking | Less satisfying (no "work" = feels less substantial) | 1 cup = edible portion |
| **Edamame in pods** | Satisfying (shelling + eating takes time = more satisfaction) | Requires shucking, pods waste | 1 cup pods = approx 2/3 cup edible |

**GLP-1 appetite reality:**
- **Shelled:** If you just want protein quickly
- **In-pod:** If you want extended eating time (tricks stomach into thinking you ate more)

## Buying & Storage

**Where to buy:**
- **Frozen section:** Most grocery stores (Asian section or near frozen veggies)
- **Asian grocery stores:** Usually better prices/larger bags
- **Online:** Bulk options (good if you eat frequently)

**Storage:**
- **Frozen:** Edamame frozen well for 6-12 months
- **Defrosted:** Use within 2-3 days (don't refreeze)
- **Fresh (rarely available):** Use same day

**Serving size considerations:**
- **1 cup shelled:** 18g protein, 190 cal
- **1 cup in-pod:** After shucking, approx 2/3 cup edible = 12g protein, 130 cal
- Adjust accordingly if buying bulk pods

## Meal Prep Ideas

**Pre-ahead cooking:**

## Common Questions

**Is edamame GMO?**
- Most soy IS genetically modified in US
- Non-GMO options exist (look for organic or non-GMO labels)
- Glycine max (soybean) = edamame, tofu, soy milk, etc.
- If avoiding GMO: Buy organic edamame

**Is edamame the same as soybeans?**
- Edamame = immature soybeans (picked green)
- Mature soybeans = dried, used for tofu, soy milk, soy sauce, etc.
- Edamame has different taste, texture, nutrition

**Can I eat edamame every day?**
- Yes, 1 cup daily = reasonable for most people
- Soy is generally considered safe and healthy
- If concerned: Rotate with other proteins (lentils, beans, etc.)

**Why not just eat peas?**
- Green peas: 8g protein per cup (less than half edamame's 18g)
- Edamame: More complete protein profile
- For same protein: Need 2+ cups peas vs 1 cup edamame

> [!WARNING] Watch sodium seasoning
- Edamame itself has little sodium
- But seasonings add up (soy sauce especially)
- If sodium-conscious: Use fresh herbs, citrus, garlic powder instead of salty sauces

> [!NOTE] Edamame is a legume (beans, peas, lentils)
- Same family as peanuts, chickpeas, beans
- Safe for most but if allergic to ONE legume (peanuts) - may have issue with others too
- Peanuts = legume, not nut (common misconception)
- If peanut allergy: Test edamame carefully first with small amount

> [!BONUS] Edamame is COMPLETE protein
- Most plant proteins are incomplete (missing some amino acids)
- Edamame = complete protein profile (like animal protein)
- Rice + beans = complete. Edamame alone = complete
- Better option than single plant protein

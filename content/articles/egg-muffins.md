> [!TIP] Silicone muffin cups
> They don't stick. Pop them out frozen, reheat in microwave. Steel muffin tins require oil + sticking.

## Why this works
Eggs are the perfect protein. Muffin format = portable, freezable, minimal chewing required.

## Ingredients
- 12 eggs (6g protein each × 12 = 72g protein)
- 1/2 cup shredded cheese (optional, adds flavor + calories)
- 1 cup chopped veggies (spinach, peppers, onions - any mix)
- Salt + pepper to taste
- Optional: Cooked bacon bits, diced ham

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Whisk eggs in a bowl. Add salt + pepper.
3. Stir in cheese + veggies.
4. Pour into silicone muffin cups (fill 3/4 full).
5. Bake 20-25 minutes until set.
6. Cool, then freeze in bags (2-3 per bag).

## Reheating
**Frozen:** Microwave 60-90 seconds.
**Thawed:** Microwave 30-45 seconds.

## Flavor Variations
- **Spinach + Feta:** Add 1 cup cooked spinach, 1/2 cup feta cheese.
- **Bacon + Cheddar:** 1/2 cup cooked bacon bits + sharp cheddar.
- **Plain:** Eggs + salt only (good for very low appetite).
- **Southwest:** Diced tomatoes, green chilies, pepper jack cheese.

> [!WARNING] Don't overcook
- Overcooked eggs = rubbery texture (nausea risk).
- Check at 20 minutes. Center should be set, not wet.

> [!NOTE] Protein math
- 12 eggs × 6g = 72g total
- That's 3+ days of protein at 25g/day minimum
- Or 6 muffins/day for someone needing 36g protein/day

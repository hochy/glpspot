## Why electrolytes matter on GLP-1s
If you’re eating less, you often get less sodium/potassium too. Dehydration can show up as nausea, headaches, fatigue, constipation, and dizziness.

## Ingredients
- 16–24 oz water
- Juice of 1/2 lemon (or 1–2 tbsp bottled lemon)
- A pinch of salt (start tiny)
- Optional: a squeeze of sugar-free sweetener
- Optional: magnesium glycinate (capsule taken separately, not mixed)

## Directions
1. Add lemon to water.
2. Add a pinch of salt and stir.
3. Taste and adjust.

> [!TIP] The nausea version
> Sip slowly over 30–60 minutes. Chugging can backfire.

> [!WARNING] If you have kidney disease or are on fluid/salt restrictions
> Talk to your clinician before increasing electrolytes.

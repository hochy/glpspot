> [!TIP] Protein + Strength Training = Muscle Preservation
- Diet alone: You lose fat AND muscle
- Diet + strength training: You lose mostly fat, preserve muscle
- Diet + cardio: You lose more muscle (cardio burns muscle when in deficit)

## The Reality: GLP-1s Break the "Just Diet" Rule

Historically, diet alone = ~25% muscle loss with weight shedding. Muscle is metabolically expensive; your body burns it when in a caloric deficit.

Add GLP-1s (your eating ~50% fewer calories suddenly):
- The "muscle sacrifice" accelerates
- You're losing faster than your body prefers
- Without intervention: You lose 30-40% muscle (BAD for metabolism, energy, long-term health)

**The solution:** Strength training + protein.

## What Type of Exercise?

### Strength Training (PRIORITY #1)
**Why it matters:**
- Muscle mass = metabolic rate
- More muscle = burn more calories at rest (long-term)
- Muscle = functionality (stairs, carrying things, posture)
- GLP-1s don't build muscle; they don't preserve it either

**How often:**
- **Minimum:** 2x per week, 30-45 minutes
- **Better:** 3x per week, 45-60 minutes
- **Best:** 3x per week, 60 minutes + 1 other activity day

**What to do:**
- **Compound movements:** Squats, deadlifts, bench press, rows, pull-ups, overhead press
- **Full body** each session (not split days - body builder style)
- **Moderate weight you can lift 8-12 reps** (not heavy 5-rep max, but not light 20+ rep)
- **Progressive overload:** Add weight, reps, or difficulty over time

**Example routine (3x/week):**
1. Goblet squats: 3 sets × 10 reps
2. Push-ups (modified to knees if needed): 3 sets × as many as possible
3. Dumbbell rows: 3 sets × 12 reps each side
4. Overhead press: 3 sets × 10 reps
5. Lunges: 3 sets × 10 reps each leg
6. Plank: 3 sets × hold as long as possible

### Walking (PRIORITY #2)
**Why it matters:**
- Low impact → manageable on GLP-1 energy levels
- Doesn't accelerate muscle loss (unlike intense cardio)
- Supports NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis) - your daily movement energy burn
- Improves mood, insulin sensitivity, joint health

**How often:**
- Daily: 6,000-8,000 steps minimum
- Most days: 8,000-10,000 steps
- Energy permitting: 10,000+ steps

**Why NOT intense cardio right now:**
- Running, HIIT, cycling class = high calorie burn
- In a deficit, body gets energy from WHEREVER it can
- Without strength training = burning muscle for fuel
- Save intense cardio for MAINTENANCE phase after weight stabilizes

### Flexibility/Mobility (PRIORITY #3)
**Why it matters:**
- GLP-1s don't cause joint pain directly
- BUT less physical activity = stiff muscles
- Weight loss = faster body changes → new movement mechanics
- Prevents injury in strength training

**How often:**
- 5-10 minutes after every workout
- Static stretching + foam rolling
- 1x/week dedicated mobility session (yoga, full-body stretching)

## How to Exercise When You Have Low Energy

**Days you feel okay:**
- Full workout (45-60 minutes)
- Complete all exercises

**Days your energy is half:**
- Shorten workout (20-30 minutes)
- Focus on main compound movements (squats, push-ups, rows)
- Skip isolation/accessory exercises

**Days you feel terrible:**
- Do something: 10-15 minute walk OR 5-10 gentle stretch
- The goal: movement, not "workout"
- Rest day is acceptable, but total inactivity makes everything worse

## Protein Timing Around Workouts

**Pre-workout (1-2 hours before):**
- Eat protein-rich meal/snack
- 20-30g protein minimum
- Example: Greek yogurt bowl, yogurt + fruit, protein smoothie

**Post-workout (within 1 hour after):**
- 25-35g protein
- This is an ANABOLIC window - muscles are primed to absorb protein
- Example: Protein shake + meal, chicken salad, cottage cheese bowl

**Rest of day:**
- Continue hitting daily protein goal (100g+ minimum for most)
- Spread protein every 3-4 hours
- Your muscles feed continuously, not just post-workout

## Common GLP-1 Exercise Challenges

### "I don't have the energy"
- Start small: 20 minutes walks, lighter weights
- Build gradually: Add 5 minutes every week
- Remember: Low energy comes from low calories. The tradeoff is temporary.
- If you NEVER have energy: talk to your doctor (medication dose, other issues)

### "I lose motivation because I'm not seeing muscle"
- Weight loss = muscle looks smaller (volume from fat disappears)
- Muscle IS there underneath, you're just leaner
- Take progress photos (not just weigh yourself)
- Strength gains = indicator (lifting more, reps increasing)

### "I'm losing weight fast, why bother with exercise?"
- Without exercise: You lose 30-40% muscle
- With exercise: You lose 10-20% muscle OR maintain/gain muscle
- Metabolic consequence: Less muscle = slower metabolism post-GLP-1
- You're building your metabolism for LIFE, not just while on medication

## Timeline Expectations

**Month 1-2:**
- Focus: Consistency over intensity
- Expect: Energy fluctuations
- Goal: Show up 2-3x/week, don't miss more than 2 days in a row

**Month 3-6:**
- Focus: Progressive overload (add weight/reps)
- Expect: Better energy, strength gains visible
- Goal: 3x/week full-body + daily walks

**Month 6+:**
- Phase shifts from "preservation" to "building"
- If weight stabilized: Add intensity, consider body recomposition
- If weight still dropping: Continue maintenance protocol

> [!WARNING] Don't start from zero + GLP-1 + aggressive program
- If you've never lifted weights before: Start with bodyweight + light dumbbells
- If you're already active: GLP-1s may reduce exercise tolerance initially
- Adjust intensity downward for 4-6 weeks while body adapts to lower calories

> [!NOTE] Muscle weighs more than fat
- Don't panic if scale stalls while strength increases
- You're trading fat tissue (less dense) for muscle tissue (more dense)
- Same weight, smaller size, better health = WIN

> [!BONUS] Exercise boosts mood
- Weight loss alone can feel restrictive/depressive
- Exercise → endorphins, better sleep, body confidence
- It's not just about muscle—it's about mental health too

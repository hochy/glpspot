> [!TIP] Use corn tortillas
- Corn tortillas = 50-70 cal each (smaller standard)
- Flour tortillas = 100-150 cal each (much heavier)
- Tacos feel indulgent with corn tortillas but keep calories reasonable

## Why This Works

**Fish taco advantages:**
- **Fresh, light:** Easier on stomach than heavier meats
- **High protein:** 6 oz fish = 35g protein spread across tacos
- **Customizable:** Add/subtract toppings for appetite/texture preferences
- **Different from standard fare:** Keeps meals from getting boring

**GLP-1 portion reality:**
- Restaurant: 3-4 tacos + side + chips = 1000+ cal
- This recipe: 2-3 tacos = legitimate meal (350-450 cal)
- Appetite naturally smaller = won't eat restaurant portions anyway

## Fish Options

| Fish Type | Protein (6 oz) | Flavor | Best For |
|-----------|---------------|--------|----------|
| **Cod/White fish** | 25-30g | Mild | Classic, versatile |
| **Tilapia** | 30g | Mild | Inexpensive, cooks fast |
| **Mahi-Mahi** | 30g | Mild | Similar to cod, slightly firm |
| **Halibut** | 35g | Mild | Higher protein, pricier |
| **Salmon** | 35g | Rich | Strong flavor (not traditional, but good) |
| **Shrimp** | 25g | Sweet | Already covered separately |

**Recommendation:**
- Cod/Tilapia = inexpensive, mild, cooks fast
- Halibut/Mahi-Mahi = if budget allows, slightly firmer
- Salmon = if you like strong fish flavor (not traditional but works)

## Base Recipe (Cod Fish Tacos)

**Ingredients (makes 4-6 tacos):**

**Marinade/Seasoning:**
- 6 oz cod fillet (or tilapia/mahi-mahi)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp lime juice (fresh)
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- Salt + pepper

**Tacos:**
- 4-6 small corn tortillas (50-70 cal each)
- 1/2 cup shredded cabbage or lettuce mix
- 1/2 cup pico de gallo (salsa)
- 2 tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped
- Optional: 1/4 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt
- Optional: 2 tbsp cotija cheese (crumbly white cheese, optional)

**Directions:**
1. **Marinade fish:** Mix olive oil + lime juice + spices. Rub over fish (15 min marinade OK, longer is fine).
2. **Cook fish:**
   - **Pan-sear:** Hot skillet with oil, 3-4 min per side.
   - **Oven bake:** 400°F for 8-12 min (for larger pieces).
   - **Air fryer:** 8-10 min at 375°F.
3. **Season fish:** Additional salt + pepper if needed.
4. **Warm tortillas:** Briefly warm in dry pan 30 sec per side (softens, not crunchy).
5. **Assemble tacos:** Flake fish, distribute across tortillas, add cabbage, pico de gallo, cilantro.
6. **Add optional toppings:** Sour cream/Greek yogurt + cotija cheese.
7. **Serve** with lime wedges (fresh squeeze adds brightness).

## Cooking Methods

### Pan-Seared (Preferred)

**Why it works:**
- Creates slight crust on fish
- Fast cooking
- Easy to watch doneness

**Method:**
- Heat skillet medium-high, add 1 tsp oil.
- Sear fish 3-4 min per side.
- Done when fish flakes easily.

### Oven-Baked

**Why it works:**
- Hands-off
- Good for larger pieces
- Less oil needed

**Method:**
- Preheat 400°F.
- Place cod on baking sheet (lined with parchment).
- Season as above with oil + spices.
- Bake 8-12 min until translucent (cooking time varies by thickness).

### Air Fryer (Fast)

**Why it works:**
- Fast, consistent cooking
- Less oil than pan-sear
- Crisps slightly (fish doesn't fry, but nice effect)

**Method:**
- Preheat 375°F.
- Place cod in basket (may need 2 batches depending on size).
- Cook 8-10 min, flip halfway.

## Topping Variations

### Classic Baja Style
- Cabbage + pico de gallo + sour cream
- Fresh cilantro, radish slices
- Lime wedges

### Spicy Arrabbiata
- Add jalapeño slices + hot sauce
- Omit sour cream (or use Greek yogurt mixed with hot sauce)
- Extra chili powder in fish seasoning

### Avocado Cream
- Mash 1/2 avocado + 1 tbsp lime juice + 2 tbsp Greek yogurt
- Use instead of sour cream (healthy fat substitute)
- Adds creaminess without heavy calories

### Mango Salsa
- Replace pico de gallo with mango salsa (sweeter)
- Still use cabbage crunch
- Tropical spin on classic

### Greek Yogurt "Sour Cream"
- 2 tbsp Greek yogurt + 1 tsp lime juice + 1 tsp cumin
- mimics sour cream, adds protein, fewer calories

**Comparison:**
- Regular sour cream: 60 cal per 2 tbsp, 0g protein
- Greek yogurt sub: 30 cal per 2 tbsp, 4g protein

## Tortilla Options

| Tortilla Type | Calories | Protein | Flavor Profile |
|---------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Corn tortilla (small)** | 50-70 cal | 1-2g | Authentic, corn flavor |
| **Flour tortilla (small)** | 100-150 cal | 2-3g | Softer, less corn taste |
| **Cauliflower tortilla** | 30-60 cal | 0-1g | Low carb alternative |
| **Coconut tortilla** | 30-50 cal | 0g | Grain-free option |

**Recommendation:**
- Corn tortillas = authentic, low-cal
- If intolerant: Cauliflower or coconut (more expensive option)
- Avoid large flour tortillas (too calorie-dense for GLP-1 portions)

## Side Options

**As complete meal (with small side):**
- **Guacamole:** 1/2 avocado mashed = 120 cal + healthy fats
- **Black beans:** 1/4 cup = 60 cal + fiber
- **Mexican rice:** 1/4 cup = 50-70 cal (if you can handle starch)
- **Extra veggies:** Cucumber, jicama, radish (minimal calories, crunch)

**Avoid standard restaurant sides:**
- Chips and salsa: 400-500 cal for small portion
- Fried side dishes: Add unnecessary calories
- Heavy refried beans: Can be 200 cal for 1/2 cup

## Meal Prep

**Fish cooking:**
- Fish doesn't hold up well as leftovers (gets fishy).
- Cook fresh day-of (best approach).
- Or cook fish in morning, assemble tacos for dinner later.

**Tortillas/toppings:**
- Tortillas hold for days.
- Cabbage/lettuce: Prep ahead, store separately.
- Pico de gallo: Fresh is best, but store-bought works.
- Cilantro: Freshest same day

**Reheating:**
- **Fish:** Reheating makes fish fishy - best cooked fresh
- **Tortillas:** 30 sec microwave or toaster (warms, not crunchy)
- **Assembly:** Assemble tacos right before eating

> [!WARNING] Watch fish doneness
- Undercooked fish: Still translucent, raw texture
- Perfect: Flakes easily with fork, opaque throughout
- Overcooked: Dry, tough, unpleasant (fish dries out fast)
- Better undercooked than overcooked (for cod - firm white fish like halibut, aim for perfect)

> [!NOTE] Cod vs Tilapia
- Cod: Slightly firmer texture, tends to be higher quality
- Tilapia: Often cheaper, softer texture
- Both work fine in tacos
- Freshness matters more than variety (off fish = bad tacos regardless)

> [!BONUS] Fish is lean protein
- 6 oz cod = 120-150 cal, 30g protein WITHOUT tortilla/toppings
- Compare: 6 oz beef = 350-400 cal, 30g protein (much higher fat/calories)
- Same protein, way fewer calories with fish

> [!TIP] This is serious, but manageable
- Gallstones are common with rapid weight loss (GLP-1s + obesity surgery)
- Symptoms are usually manageable if caught early
- Prevention is possible with diet + awareness

## What's the Gallbladder & Why It Matters

**Gallbladder function:**
- Stores bile produced by liver
- Bile digests fats
- When you eat fat: Gallbladder contracts → releases bile → breaks down fat
- Rapid weight loss = less fat intake → bile sits stagnant → forms stones

**Why weight loss causes gallstones:**
1. **Stagnant bile:** Less fat to digest = bile sits in gallbladder longer
2. **Cholesterol concentration:** Rapid fat loss releases stored cholesterol → bile gets concentrated
3. **Gallbladder contraction declines:** With less fat, muscle walls weaken → emptying less efficiently
4. **Rapid change:** Body can't adapt quickly enough

**Gallstones =:** Hardened cholesterol/bilrubin deposits in gallbladder.
- Small stones: May pass without issues (or you don't know you have them)
- Larger stones: Block bile ducts → pain, inflammation, infection

## Risk Factors

**High Risk (pay extra attention):**
- Losing >3-5 pounds/month consistently
- BMI >35 before starting GLP-1
- Family history of gallstones
- Female, over 40 (women get gallstones 3x more than men)
- Previous rapid weight loss attempts

**Moderate Risk:**
- Losing 1-3 pounds/month
- BMI 30-35 before starting GLP-1
- Age 30-40
- Mild family history

**Lower Risk (but still possible):**
- Losing <1-2 pounds/month
- BMI <30
- Younger than 30
- No family history

## Gallstone Symptoms

**Symptomless (asymptomatic):**
- Most gallstones don't cause problems
- May never know you have them
- Don't require treatment unless symptoms develop

**Painful (symptomatic):**
- **Biliary colic:** Sudden, intense pain in upper right abdomen
- Pain radiates to:
  - Right shoulder
  - Back between shoulder blades
- Trigger: Eating fatty/heavy meal
- Duration: 30 minutes to several hours
- Stops when stone moves or passes

**Emergency symptoms (call doctor/ER immediately):**
- **Acute cholecystitis:** Infection/inflammation of gallbladder
  - Fever, chills
  - Persistent pain >6 hours
  - Nausea, vomiting
  - Jaundice (yellowing skin/eyes)

## Prevention: What You CAN Do

### #1: EAT REGULAR FAT (Not Zero Fat)

This is counterintuitive but critical:

| Wrong Approach | Right Approach |
|----------------|----------------|
| Cut all fat to lose faster | Keep SOME fat every day |
| Eat <10g fat/day | Eat 20-25g healthy fat/day |
| Avoid oils, nuts, avocado | Include healthy fats in every meal |

**Why you NEED fat:**
- Fat triggers gallbladder contraction (empties bile)
- Emptying bile = prevents stagnation = less stone formation
- Aim: 20-25g healthy fat/day minimum (olive oil, nuts, avocado, fatty fish)

**Healthy fat sources:**
- **Olive oil:** 1 tbsp = 13.5g fat (use for cooking, salads)
- **Avocado:** 1/2 = 15g fat + fiber + potassium
- **Fatty fish:** Salmon, mackerel, sardines (omega-3s + protein + fat)
- **Nuts/seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, chia, flax (small handful = healthy)

### #2: STAY HYDRATED

**Why hydration matters:**
- Bile is water-based; adequate hydration = less concentrated bile
- Concentrated bile = stone formation
- Water dilutes bile composition

**How much:**
- Minimum: 64 oz (8 cups) daily
- Better: 80-100 oz daily if rapid weight loss
- MORE if exercising, sweating, hot weather

**Hydration markers (you're hydrated when):**
- Urine is light yellow/clear
- Thirst is manageable, not extreme
- No dark urine infrequently

### #3: INCREASE FIBER INTAKE

**Why fiber helps:**
- Binds with cholesterol in digestive tract
- Less cholesterol recycling = less concentrated bile
- Soluble fiber specifically binds bile salts

**High-fiber foods:**
- Vegetables: Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots
- Legumes: Lentils, chickpeas, black beans
- Whole grains: Oats, quinoa, brown rice
- Fruits: Apples, pears, berries

**Aim for:**
- 25-35g fiber/day minimum
- Spread across all meals (not all in one sitting)

### #4: PROTEIN-RICH DIET

**Why protein matters:**
- Adequate protein = lean tissue preservation
- Less lean tissue loss = steadier metabolism = more gradual weight loss
- Gradual loss = lower gallstone risk vs. aggressive loss

**Target:**
- Minimum: 100g protein/day for most
- Higher (150g+) if you're losing aggressively

### #5: SLOW DOWN WEIGHT LOSS (If Concerned)

If you're losing >5 pounds/month consistently:
- Talk to doctor about dose adjustment
- Slightly slower loss = significantly lower gallstone risk
- Tradeoff: Slightly slower results vs. gallbladder safety

## Food Habits That Help

### Eat regularly (not skipping meals)
- Fasting prolongs bile stagnation
- Regular meals = regular bile emptying
- Aim: 3 meals + 1-2 snacks daily

### Don't go ultra-low calorie (<800/day)
- Extreme calorie restriction = rapid fat loss = poor gallbladder contraction
- GLP-1s already reduce appetite; don't compound
- Aim: 1200-1500 calories minimum for most adults

### Avoid extreme high-fat binges
- GLP-1s reduce appetite naturally
- Bingeing on super-high-fat meals triggers intense contraction
- Can dislodge stones → biliary colic
- If you indulge: Space out, don't eat 100g fat in one sitting

## Medical Monitoring

**Talk to doctor about:**
- Ultrasound if you have symptoms (pain, family history, high risk)
- Monitoring if you're in high-risk group
- Preventive medication (ursodeoxycholic acid) if very high risk
- Symptoms = when to call vs. ER

**When to call doctor:**
- Right upper abdominal pain (especially after fatty meal)
- Pain radiating to shoulder/back (classic gallstone symptom)
- Nausea + vomiting + abdominal pain
- Fever + pain (possible infection)

**When to go to ER:**
- Severe, unrelenting pain >6 hours
- Fever >101°F + abdominal pain
- Jaundice (yellowing eyes/skin)
- Can't keep anything down (dehydration risk)

## Long-Term Expectations

**During active weight loss:**
- Bile is stagnant, stone formation risk
- Prevention habits are MOST critical now

**After weight stabilizes:**
- Risk remains higher than pre-weight loss
- Continue good habits (fat intake, hydration, fiber)
- Symptoms lessen but not disappear entirely

**If stones develop:**
- Asymptomatic: No treatment needed (monitor)
- Symptomatic (mild): Dietary changes, medication attempt
- Symptomatic (severe/recurring): Gallbladder removal surgery
- Removal is routine, low-risk laparoscopic procedure
- Most people live normally without gallbladder

> [!WARNING] Don't cut fat to lose faster
- Zero fat diets dramatically increase gallstone risk
- You still need 20-25g healthy fat/day
- GLP-1s suppress appetite enough - don't compound extremes

> [!NOTE] Asymptomatic stones are common
- ~10-15% of general population has gallstones without knowing
- Up to 30% with rapid weight loss develop them
- Most are symptomless and require no treatment

> [!BONUS] Coffee reduces gallstone risk
- Moderate coffee consumption (2-4 cups/day) associated with risk reduction
- Mechanism unclear, but statistically supported
- Don't start coffee if you don't drink it, but okay if you already do

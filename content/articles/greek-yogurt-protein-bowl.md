> [!TIP] Protein-first rule
> Start with protein before fruit/granola. If you stop early, you still “won” the meal.

## Why this works on GLP-1s
When appetite is low, you need *dense nutrition in a small volume*. Greek yogurt is easy to eat, high in protein, and very configurable.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup (225g) plain nonfat or 2% Greek yogurt
- 1 scoop whey or casein protein (optional but powerful)
- 1/2 cup berries (fresh or frozen)
- 1 tbsp chia seeds (optional)
- 1 tbsp peanut butter or almond butter (optional)
- Cinnamon or a sugar-free sweetener to taste

## Directions
1. Add yogurt to a bowl.
2. Mix in protein powder (if using). Add a splash of water/milk to smooth it out.
3. Top with berries + chia.
4. Add nut butter if you need more calories.

## Variations
- **Low-nausea version:** skip chia and nut butter; keep it simple.
- **Higher-calorie version:** add 1/4 cup granola + nut butter.
- **Electrolyte boost:** a small pinch of salt can actually make it taste better and helps hydration.

> [!NOTE] If dairy doesn’t sit well
> Try lactose-free Greek yogurt, or swap to a high-protein plant yogurt + a scoop of protein.

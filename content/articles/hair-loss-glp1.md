> [!TIP] This is a sign of SUCCESS
- Hair loss occurs because your body is losing weight faster than it's "comfortable" with.
- It's temporary. It grows back.
- Don't stop your medication over this alone.

## What's Happening (The Science)

**Telogen effluvium** = temporary hair shedding triggered by rapid weight loss, illness, or stress.

**The timeline:**
- **Trigger:** Rapid weight loss begins
- **Delay phase:** 2-3 months (hair stays in scalp, looks normal)
- **Shedding phase:** 3-6 months in (hair falls out in clumps)
- **Recovery phase:** 6-9 months (new hair visible, continues growth)

**Why this happens:**
- Your body allocates energy to weight loss, hair becomes "non-essential"
- ~50% of hair follicles simultaneously shift from growth phase to rest
- Rest phase ends → hair falls out → new cycle begins

## The Reality Check

**Who experiences this:**
- ~70-80% of people losing 10+ pounds/month
- More common with aggressive GLP-1 doses (higher tirzepatide, semaglutide)
- Affects all hair types (curly, straight, textured)

**How bad it gets:**
- Mild: Extra hair in drain, hairbrush has more than normal
- Moderate: More hair than usual for 2-3 weeks
- Severe: Noticeable thinning, bald-ish spots (extremely rare in most cases)

**Recovery timeline:**
- Starts improving: 6-9 months after you stabilize weight
- Full recovery: 12-18 months from initial trigger
- Hair grows back SAME as it was before (thicker if you gained weight previously, etc.)

## What You CAN Do (Minimize + Support)

> [!NOTE] Nothing stops it completely
- The best you can do is minimize severity + speed up recovery.
- Hair loss from weight loss is largely physiological, not fixable with supplements alone.

### Nutrition Support

**Protein (non-negotiable):**
- Minimum: 100g protein/day while losing
- Hair = keratin = made of protein
- Not enough protein = worse shedding

**Specific nutrients:**
- **Biotin:** 2.5-5mg daily (found in eggs, nuts, salmon)
- **Iron:** Especially important for women (menstruation + weight loss = deficiency risk)
- **Vitamin D:** Many people are deficient; affects hair health
- **Zinc:** Supports hair growth

**Foods to eat:**
- Eggs (biotin protein bomb)
- Salmon (omega-3s reduce inflammation)
- Spinach (iron, vitamin C)
- Nuts/seeds (biotin, zinc)
- Bone broth (collagen protein)

### What NOT To Do

| Don't Do This | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Stop GLP-1 medication | Hair sheds anyway from weight loss you ALREADY did |
| Start aggressive supplements | Expensive, limited evidence, risk of interactions |
| Panic | Stress makes it worse (cortisol affects hair) |
| Expect instant fixes | Hair grows ~1/2 inch/month, minimum 6-month timeline |

### Styling + Care

**During shedding phase:**
- Gentle shampoos (no harsh sulfates)
- Avoid heat styling when possible
- Don't over-wash (strips natural oils)
- Scalp massages (stimulates blood flow, minimal evidence but can't hurt)

**Recovery phase:**
- Regular trims (split ends break off, making shedding seem worse)
- Continue protein support
- Patience (it's growing, you just can't see it yet)

## When to See a Doctor

See your doctor if:
- Hair loss continues 12+ months after weight stabilization
- You see patchy bald spots (different than overall thinning)
- Hair is breaking off mid-shaft (not shedding at root)
- You have other symptoms (extreme fatigue, rapid breathing)

These may indicate thyroid issues, iron deficiency, or hormonal problems unrelated to weight loss.

## The Mindset Shift

**Reframe this:**
- Temporary shedding = proof system is working
- Your body is prioritizing weight loss (your health goal) over hair
- In 12-18 months: weight stabilized + hair back = you win both

**What helps:**
- Track progress (photos every 2 months)
- Celebrate non-scale victories (energy, clothes fit, health markers)
- Remember: THIS IS TEMPORARY

> [!WARNING] This is NOT male pattern baldness
- Telogen effluvium = temporary, all-over thinning
- Male pattern baldness = permanent, specific pattern (receding hairline, crown)
- Different mechanisms, different outcomes

> [!NOTE] Biotin supplements
- Over-the-counter: 5,000-10,000mcg doses marketed heavily
- Most of this is excreted in urine (waste of money)
- 2.5-5mg is adequate for most
- Don't expect miracles from biotin alone

# 15 High-Protein Recipes When You're Just Not Hungry

One of the biggest challenges on GLP-1 medications? Getting enough protein when your appetite has vanished. Your body still needs 60-80g of protein daily to maintain muscle while losing weight.

These recipes deliver maximum protein in minimal portions. Each serving packs 20-30g of protein without overwhelming your smaller stomach.

## Savory Options

### 1. Egg White Veggie Scramble
**Protein: 26g | Serving: 1 cup**

Sauté 1 cup egg whites with spinach, diced tomatoes, and a sprinkle of feta. Takes 5 minutes, keeps you full for hours.

**Variation:** Add diced turkey sausage for an extra 10g protein.

### 2. Greek Yogurt Power Bowl
**Protein: 28g | Serving: ¾ cup**

Mix plain Greek yogurt with hemp seeds, a drizzle of honey, and fresh berries. Probiotic and protein-packed.

**Tip:** Choose full-fat Greek yogurt for better satiety.

### 3. Mini Chicken Lettuce Wraps
**Protein: 24g | Serving: 2 wraps**

Diced chicken breast tossed with avocado, lime, and cilantro. Served in butter lettuce cups. Light but satisfying.

### 4. Cottage Cheese & Smoked Salmon
**Protein: 32g | Serving: ½ cup cottage cheese + 3oz salmon**

Layer cottage cheese with flaked smoked salmon, everything bagel seasoning, and capers. Fancy but effortless.

### 5. Protein-Packed Bone Broth
**Protein: 20g | Serving: 2 cups**

Simmer with shredded chicken, vegetables, and collagen powder. Warm, comforting, and easy to sip slowly.

### 6. Tuna Avocado Boats
**Protein: 25g | Serving: 1 avocado half**

Mix canned tuna with Greek yogurt instead of mayo. Stuff into avocado halves. Keto-friendly and delicious.

### 7. Shrimp & Zucchini Skewers
**Protein: 24g | Serving: 4-5 skewers**

Grilled shrimp threaded with zucchini ribbons. Brush with garlic butter. Restaurant-quality at home.

## Sweet Options

### 8. Protein Smoothie (Small)
**Protein: 30g | Serving: 8 oz**

Blend protein powder, unsweetened almond milk, frozen berries, and spinach. You won't taste the greens, promise.

**Pro tip:** Make it thicker and eat with a spoon—"slows" the meal.

### 9. Chia Seed Protein Pudding
**Protein: 22g | Serving: ½ cup**

Mix chia seeds, protein powder, and almond milk. Let sit overnight. Topped with crushed almonds.

### 10. Mini Protein Pancakes
**Protein: 20g | Serving: 2 small pancakes**

Blend banana, 2 eggs, and protein powder. Cook silver dollar-sized. Top with Greek yogurt instead of syrup.

### 11. Peanut Butter Protein Bites
**Protein: 8g per bite | Serving: 3 bites**

Mix peanut butter, oats, protein powder, and a touch of honey. Roll into balls. Perfect for when even a meal feels like too much.

## Quick Emergency Meals

### 12. Rotisserie Chicken + Greek Yogurt
**Protein: 35g | Serving: 4oz chicken + ½ cup yogurt**

Shredded rotisserie chicken mixed with plain Greek yogurt (instead of mayo), herbs, and celery. Zero cooking required.

### 13. Sardines on Whole Grain
**Protein: 23g | Serving: 1 can sardines + 1 slice bread**

Mash canned sardines (in olive oil) onto whole grain toast with lemon juice and cracked pepper. Sounds fancy, couldn't be easier. Rich in omega-3s too.

### 14. Edamame in the Pod
**Protein: 18g | Serving: 1 cup**

Steam frozen edamame, sprinkle with sea salt. Eat straight from the pod—it's meditative and slows you down. A perfect desk-side snack.

**Tip:** Buy the pre-shelled ones if you're feeling lazy.

### 15. Turkey & Cheese Roll-Ups
**Protein: 20g | Serving: 3 roll-ups**

Spread cream cheese on sliced turkey breast. Add pickle or bell pepper strips. Roll up like sushi. No cooking, completely satisfying.

## The Bottom Line

You don't need to eat massive meals to hit your protein goals. Small, strategic portions throughout the day work just as well—and are much more comfortable with a GLP-1-modified appetite.

**Weekly prep tip:** Make 3-4 protein bites or hard-boil a dozen eggs on Sunday. Having high-protein options ready prevents the "I don't know what to eat" trap that leads to skipping meals entirely.

Remember: Something is better than nothing. Even a small protein snack beats an empty stomach.

# Lentil Soup: 20g Protein in 1 Bowl Recipe

Soup is perfect for GLP-1 appetites. Warm, soft texture (easy to digest), loads of fiber and protein, and you can still eat a satisfying bowl without overloading your stomach.

This lentil soup is loaded with plant protein, vegetables, and warm flavors that don't overwhelm reduced appetite.

## Ingredients

*2 cups brown or green lentils* - 36g protein for entire recipe
- Washed thoroughly
- Red/brown lentils cook faster (20 min)
- Green lentils hold shape better (30 min)

*1 medium onion, chopped*
- Yellow onions are sweeter, red onions are sharper
- Both work fine

*2-3 medium carrots, sliced*
- 4-5 carrots total
- Adds natural sweetness + beta carotene

*3-4 stalks celery, chopped*
- Adds aromatic flavor + texture

*1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes*
- Fire-roasted or regular
- Adds acidity + brightness

*4 cups vegetable broth or chicken broth*
- Vegetable broth = pure plant protein
- Chicken broth = extra flavor + protein

*2-3 cloves garlic, minced*

*1 teaspoon dried thyme or oregano* — herbs of your choice

*Salt and black pepper* — to taste

*Optional: 1 bay leaf* — aromatic, remove before serving

*Optional: 2 cups fresh spinach* — adds more protein + nutrition

In a large pot or Dutch oven:
- Heat 1-2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat

### Step 3: Simmer (15-25 minutes)
Cover and simmer until lentils are tender (18-20 min for brown, 25-30 min for green):
- Stir occasionally
- Add more broth if too thick (soup consistency preference)
- Remove bay leaf before serving

### Step 4: Add Spinach (1 minute)
If using spinach: Add in last minute
- Stir until just wilted
- Remove from heat

## Why Lentils?

Lentils are GLP-1 superfoods for multiple reasons:

**1. High Protein per Volume:** 
- 18g protein per cup cooked lentils
- Plant-based, complete with rice or dairy 
- Easy to digest (mild on stomach)

**2. High Fiber:**
- 15g fiber per cup cooked lentils
- Slows carbohydrate absorption
- Increases satiety

**3. Long Lasting Energy:**
- Complex carbs digest slowly
- Sustained energy without crashes

**4. Inexpensive:**
- Way cheaper per gram of protein than meat
- Affordable for everyday meals

## How to Eat It Like a Pro

**Option A: The "Protein-First" Bowl Method**
- Eat all protein-rich pieces first (lentils, any chicken/beans you add)
- Then vegetables and broth
- Protein triggers satiety, then eat until done

**Option B: The Small Bowl Method**
- Have smaller portion (half recipe size = 10-11g protein)
- Add a side: one slice sourdough, small piece of cheese, protein shake
- Together = 25g+ protein total

**Option C: The Post-Soup Protein**
- Have bowl of soup
- Wait 15-20 min
- Then supplement with another 10-15g protein if still hungry (Greek yogurt, handful nuts, protein shake)

---

**Lentil soup keeps you full for hours.** The combination of protein, fiber, and liquid is a satiety triple.

Perfect for lunch, dinner, or when you want warm comfort without overeating.

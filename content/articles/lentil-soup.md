> [!TIP] Canned lentils work
- No sorting, no soaking, cook time 15 min vs 45 min
- Slightly more expensive, huge time savings
- For GLP-1 low-energy days: Use canned

## Why This Works

**Lentils advantages:**
- **Plant protein:** 18g per bowl without animal products
- **Fiber:** 12-15g per bowl (excellent for digestion, satiety)
- **Inexpensive:** \$2-3 for entire pot (4+ meals)
- **Comfort food:** Soups feel substantial, warm, satisfying
- **Long shelf life:** Dry lentils last 1+ years in pantry

**GLP-1 specific:**
- One bowl = legitimate meal (18g protein)
- Soups are easy to digest (cooked thoroughly)
- Fiber = satiety = you feel satisfied with less
- Plant protein = no heavy feeling of dense meat

4. **Add broth:** Pour in 6 cups broth+ can of tomatoes (if using).
5. **Simmer:** Bring to boil, reduce heat, simmer 35-40 min.

## Serving Ideas

**As meal (18g protein per bowl):**
- **Pure:** Just soup (filling enough for GLP-1 portion)
- **With side:** Small crusty bread (100 cal), or croutons
- **Protein boost:** Add 1-2 oz shredded chicken or 1 egg boiled (adds 10g protein per egg = 28g total protein)

**As side:**
- Half bowl = 9g protein (great alongside main protein)
- Pair with smaller protein + veggies

**Garnishes:**
- **Fresh herbs:** Parsley, thyme, basil (adds freshness)
- **Crusty bread:** Dip in broth, adds substance
- **Yogurt dollop:** Plain Greek yogurt (adds protein + creaminess)

## Meal Prep & Storage

**Making ahead:**
- Soups actually taste better next day (flavors meld)
- Make a big batch (double above recipe).
- Portion into 4 containers.

**Freezing:**
- Lentil soup freezes well (3-6 months)
- Leave slight headroom for expansion (don't fill to brim)
- Reheat from freezer in microwave 3-4 min + stir halfway.

**Reheating:**
- Fridge to microwave: 2-3 min
- Freezer to microwave: 3-4 min + stir
- From freezer to fridge overnight = faster reheating

## Lentil Varieties

| Lentil Type | Cook Time | Texture | Best For |
|-------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Brown lentils** | 35-45 min | Holds shape | Soups, stews |
| **Green lentils** | 35-40 min | Holds shape | Salads, soups |
| **Red lentils** | 20-25 min | Softens/thickens | Thick soups, curries |
| **French green/Puy** | 30-40 min | Texture | Salads, fancy dishes |

**Recommendation:**
- Brown or green lentils for most soups (texture holds up)
- Red lentils if you want thicker, creamier texture
- French green are similar to green but more expensive

## Buying & Storing

**Storage:**
- **Dry lentils:** Cook for 1+ years in pantry, cool dry spot
- **Canned lentils:** Keep 1+ years in pantry
- **Cooked lentils:** 3-4 days fridge, 3-6 months frozen

**Where to buy:**
- **Grocery store:** Bulk bins or packaged
- **Bulk stores (Costco)**: Large bags (good if you cook weekly)
- **Online:** Sometimes organic/imported lentils

**Quality:**
- Whole, unbroken lentils cook evenly (sort out debris/discolored)
- Check for expiration date (old lentils take forever to cook)

> [!WARNING] Check labels on canned lentils
- Some are pre-seasoned (adds sodium, extra flavor you may not want)
- "Simple" or "plain" = just lentils in water = best flexibility
- Rinse canned lentils to remove canning brine sodium

> [!NOTE] Lentils + rice = complete protein
- Lentils = plant protein but not complete (missing some amino acids)
- Rice has complementary amino acids
- Lentils + small portion rice = complete protein profile
- NOT necessary daily, but good occasionally for variety

> [!BONUS] Lentils are inexpensive
- 1 lb dry lentils = \$2-3
- Makes 4+ generous bowls
- Compare: 6 oz chicken = \$4-5 for one meal
- Plant protein = budget friendly

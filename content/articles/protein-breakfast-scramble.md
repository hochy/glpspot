# Protein Breakfast Scramble: 25g Protein in 10 Minutes

On GLP-1 medications, breakfast becomes crucial - but also tricky. You might have less appetite in the morning, yet you need protein to maintain muscle mass and feel satisfied throughout the day.

This scramble is designed specifically for reduced appetites: It's quick to make, easy to digest, and packs 25g of protein into a single bowl that feels satisfying without being overwhelming.

## Ingredients

*3 large eggs* - 18g protein

*1 cup fresh spinach* - 1g protein, fiber for fullness

*1/4 cup shredded mozzarella or cheddar cheese* - 7g protein

*1 tablespoon olive oil or butter* - healthy fats for satiety

*Salt and black pepper* - to taste

*Optional additions:*
- 1/2 avocado (adds healthy fats and creaminess)
- 2-3 cherry tomatoes (for color)
- 1/8 cup feta cheese (for salty, crumbly texture)

## Instructions

### 1. PREP (2 minutes)
Rinse and roughly chop the spinach. If tomatoes, halve them. Get your eggs cracked into a bowl and whisked until yolks and whites are well-combined.

### 2. COOK (5 minutes)
- Heat oil or butter in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat
- Add chopped spinach and sauté for 2 minutes until wilted and bright green
- Pour in beaten eggs
- Using a heat-resistant spatula, gently push eggs from edges toward center, allowing uncooked eggs to flow to edges
- Continue this folding motion until eggs are mostly set but still slightly glossy (they'll finish in the pan)
- Remove from heat
- Sprinkle cheese over eggs and cover pan for 1 minute to melt

### 3. SERVE
Season with salt and pepper. Top with avocado or tomatoes if using.

## Why This Works for GLP-1 Appetites

**Protein density:** 25g protein from eggs and cheese - hits about half your daily protein needs in one meal.

**Volume-friendly:** Eggs cook down but the spinach adds volume without significant calories (25 calories per cup).

**Cooked, soft texture:** Scrambled eggs are easy to digest than fibrous or heavy foods - especially important if you're experiencing any GLP-1-related nausea in the morning.

**Quick prep:** No more than 10 minutes from fridge to table - when you're nauseous or low-energy, simple wins.

**Satiety combination:** Protein + healthy fats + small amount of fiber = the triad of fullness.

## Make-Ahead Variations

### Pre-Cook Eggs (2-Day Advance)
- Cook 2-3 batches at once
- Cool and store in sealed containers in the refrigerator
- Reheat in microwave (1-2 minutes) or pan
- Texture holds up surprisingly well

### Frozen Spinach Hack
- Keep frozen chopped spinach on hand
- Thaw in microwave (1 minute), squeeze out excess liquid with clean paper towel
- Works just as well as fresh in scrambled eggs

### Batch Ingredients
- Crack 12 eggs at once, divide among 4 containers for the week
- Pre-chop and cook a double-batch of spinach on Sunday
- Mix-ins (shredded cheese, pre-diced peppers) can be pre-portioned

## Perfect Pairings

**With your scramble:**
- **One slice of sourdough or whole grain toast** - adds 5-8g protein + satisfying carbs
- **Sides:** 1/4 cup fresh berries or 1/2 grapefruit

**After your scramble:**
- **Black coffee or herbal tea** - no sugar, supports metabolism
- **Water** - stays hydrated (GLP-1 can cause dehydration)

## Protein vs. Calorie Breakdown

| Component | Protein | Calories |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| 3 eggs | 18g | 210 |
| 1 cup spinach | 1g | 25 |
| 1/4 cup cheese | 7g | 110 |
| 1 tbsp oil | 0 | 120 |
| **Total** | **26g** | **465** |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Eggs feel heavy in the morning"** - Use 2 whole eggs + 2 egg whites instead of 3 whole. Slightly less heavy, still 20g+ protein.

**"I'm not hungry enough for this"** - That's on GLP-1. Have half. Save the rest. Protein is prioritized, but not at the expense of your medication's benefits.

**"I get nauseous from eggs"** - This is relatively common with GLP-1. Try:
- Poached eggs instead of scrambled (softer texture)
- Hard-boiled eggs with a little salt
- Switch to Greek yogurt (similar protein content, easier for some)
- Skip eggs entirely and use smoothies or protein supplements

**Protein isn't optional on GLP-1** - it's the difference between maintaining muscle mass during weight loss or losing it. This scramble makes hitting your morning protein goal manageable even with reduced morning appetite.

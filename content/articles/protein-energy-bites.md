# Protein Energy Bites: Portable 20g Protein Snack

On GLP-1 medications, you're eating less overall. But you still need protein between meals — especially if you're active or your day is long.

Buying processed protein bars works, but they're expensive, sometimes taste like cardboard, and you'd rather control the ingredients.

These energy bites solve that: homemade, 20g+ protein, no baking required, and they're genuinely delicious.

## Ingredients

*2 cups rolled oats* — 13g protein, carbohydrate for energy

*1 cup almond butter or peanut butter* — 25g protein, healthy fats

*1/2 cup honey or maple syrup* — 15g carbs, natural sweetener

*3/4 cup sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds* — 14g protein, texture crunch

*1/2 cup chia seeds* — 4g protein, omega-3 fatty acids

*1/2 cup dark chocolate chips (optional)* — 150-170g carbs (keep dark for less sugar)

*2 scoop/50g vanilla protein powder (whey or plant-based)* — 25g protein

If you want extra protein or better texture, add:
*1/4 cup peanut butter powder (PBB)* — 11g protein, peanut flavor intensifier

## Instructions

### Allergic Note
Peanut/nut allergies? Substitute almond butter for peanut butter and use roasted sunflower seeds instead of any nut-based seeds.

---

### Step 1: Mix the Dry (2 minutes)

In a large mixing bowl, combine:
- Rolled oats
- Sunflower or pumpkin seeds
- Chia seeds
- Protein powder
- (Optional protein powder)

---

### Step 2: Combine the Wet (3 minutes)

Combine in another bowl:
- Almond or peanut butter
- Honey or maple syrup

Microwave the mixture for 20-30 seconds if it's thick (just warm it a bit - don't cook)

---

### Step 3: Mix Thoroughly (4 minutes)

Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture. Stir until fully combined. The mixture should stick together when you press it — that's your ready sign.

If it's too wet: Add 1/2 cup more oats or more protein powder
If it's too dry: Add another tablespoon of honey or peanut butter

Press 1 pinch into your palm, squeeze: it should hold shape without crumbling.

---

### Step 4: Form (2 minutes)

Roll about 1-2 tbsp of mixture between your palms to form balls about 1.5 inches diameter.

You should get about 12-15 bites depending on size.

Place bites on a plate or small tray.

---

### Step 5: Chill (1 hour refrigerate)

Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to help them hold shape better. They'll be good at room temperature for snacking.

Optional: Roll bites in extra sunflower seeds, chia seeds, or protein powder for extra visual appeal/more protein.

## Make-Ahead and Storage

Refrigerator (good 1-2 weeks):
- Store in airtight container
- Separate layers with parchment paper so they don't stick

Freezer (good up to 3 months):
- Place on a single layer on parchment-lined tray
- Freeze 30 minutes, then transfer to freezer bag
- Eat straight from frozen or thaw 5 minutes before eating

## Variations

**Higher Protein Version**
- Replace 1/2 cup oats with another 1/2 scoop protein powder (now 35g+ protein)
- Keep honey the same (sweetness still works)
- Add 1/4 cup peanut butter powder (PBB) for extra protein + flavor

**Energy Boost**
- Add 2 tablespoons chia seeds (not 1/2 cup)
- Add 1-2 tablespoons brewer's yeast (add nutritional yeast for nuttier flavor)

**Lower Carb**
- Replace honey with sugar-free syrup or reduce to 1/4 cup
- Cut protein powder 8 (use 1.5 scoops instead of 2)
- Protein drops from 20g → 16g

**Fruit Flavor**
- Add 1/2 cup raisins or dried cranberries
- Replace protein powder with unflavored whey (the fruit complements it better)

## Why This Works for GLP-1 Appetites

**Small portions:** One bite is 150-170 calories — substantial protein, manageable volume
- Perfect 2-bite snack = 300-340 calories

**Nutrient-dense:** Not empty calories — every gram has protein or fiber or healthy fats
- Satisfies without overloading the system

**Portable:** Keep a container at work, in gym bag, car
- Emergency protein when hungry

**Customizable:** Adjust protein, sweetener, texture
- Works with your body, not a pre-made formula

## Common Issues Solved

"My protein shakes taste gross."
→ These taste exactly like peanut butter balls.

"I don't have time for meals in the morning."
→ 2 bites on the way to work. Done.

"I'm nauseous in the morning."
→ These don't have strong smells. Can be eaten cold.

"I'm traveling/working late and skip meals."
→ Emergency protein that doesn't need prep.

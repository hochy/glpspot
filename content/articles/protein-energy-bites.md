> [!TIP] Make double batch
- This recipe makes 12-15 bites.
- Double = easy grab-and-go snacks for 2-3 weeks.

## Why this works
GLP-1 life = eating less frequently. When you do eat, it needs to be dense. These energy bites pack 5g protein in 2 bites (one bite for smaller appetites).

## Base Recipe
**Ingredients (makes 12-15 bites):**
- 1 cup rolled oats (150 cal, 5g protein)
- 1 cup peanut butter or almond butter (640 cal, 32g protein) - **unsweetened**
- 1/2 cup protein powder (vanilla, 120 cal, 20g protein)
- 1/3 cup honey (320 cal)
- 2 tbsp chia seeds or flax seeds (80 cal, 4g protein)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Optional: Dark chocolate chips or mini chocolate chips (1/4 cup)

**Directions:**
1. Mix all ingredients in bowl until combined.
2. Roll into balls (1.5 inch diameter = golf ball size).
3. Chill in fridge 30 minutes (helps them firm up).
4. Store in airtight container.

**Storage:**
- Fridge: 2 weeks
- Freezer: 3 months (eat slightly thawed or frozen)

## Flavor Variations

### Classic Peanut Butter Bites
- Peanut butter + vanilla protein powder
- Optional: 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips

### Chocolate Almond Bites
- Almond butter + chocolate protein powder
- Optional: Dark chocolate chunks

### Coconut Bites
- Almond butter + vanilla protein powder
- Add 1/3 cup shredded coconut

### Cinnamon Raisin Bites
- Peanut butter + vanilla protein powder
- Add 1/2 cup raisins + 1 tsp cinnamon

## Portion Mindset
- **Pre-GLP-1:** Would eat 3-4 bites as snack.
- **GLP-1 reality:** 1-2 bites = substantial snack.
- **As meal:** 3 bites + glass of milk = reasonable light meal.

## When to Eat Energy Bites
- Mid-morning when you barely ate breakfast
- Pre-workout fuel (30 minutes before)
- Post-gym when you can't stomach real food yet
- Desk snack when working (minimum chewing required)

> [!WARNING] Sugar content
- Honey is real sugar (not bad, but calories add up).
- If watching calories, use stevia drops instead of honey (sacrifice some texture).
- Count each bite as 100 cal (protein + healthy fats + sugar).

> [!NOTE] Texture issues
- Too dry to form balls? Add 1-2 tbsp milk or plant milk.
- Too sticky? Chill dough in fridge 10 minutes, then roll.
- Crumbled apart? Add more oats or protein powder.

> [!BONUS] Make half-size for smaller appetites
- Roll into marble-sized bites (half size).
- 1 regular bite = 2 mini bites.
- Feels like bigger portion, easier to finish.

If you’re on a GLP-1, you might eat less. That’s the point.

But eating less can make you **tired** and **weak** if you miss protein.

## The simple rule
Try to get **20–30g of protein** at:
- breakfast
- lunch
- dinner

That’s it.

> [!TIP] Small meal? Still fine.
> Even a small meal can have protein. You don’t need a big plate.

## What 25g of protein looks like
Pick one:
- 1 scoop protein powder (check your label)
- 1 cup Greek yogurt
- 1 tuna packet
- 3–4 eggs
- 4–5 oz chicken or turkey

## If you can’t eat much
Use “easy proteins” first:
- shakes
- yogurt
- cottage cheese
- eggs

Then add carbs/fats after.

> [!NOTE] Why this works
> Protein is the hardest macro to "catch up" on later.

## A quick example day
- Breakfast: Greek yogurt bowl
- Lunch: turkey + cheese rollups
- Dinner: chicken + a few bites of rice

If you do that, you’re doing great.

> [!TIP] Freeze in cookie bags
- Store 2 cookies per bag (grab-and-go serving)
- Thaw in 5 min or eat slightly frozen (texture is fine)
- Makes meal prep easier - grab from freezer, eat anywhere

## Why This Works

**Protein cookie advantages:**
- **Portable:** No refrigeration needed (unlike Greek yogurt)
- **Freezable:** Don't need to eat within 2-3 days
- **Protein-dense:** 12g per cookie (better than 2g in regular cookies)
- **Tastes like dessert:** Sweet, chewy, satisfies cravings

**GLP-1 specific:**
- Cookies feel indulgent but are legitimate snacks/meals
- 1-2 cookies = substantial snack (12-24g protein)
- Freezable = less daily cooking effort

## Base Recipe

**Ingredients (makes 8-10 cookies):**
- 2 ripe bananas, mashed (the sweetener + binder)
- 2 eggs (12g protein)
- 1 scoop protein powder (vanilla, 20g protein)
- 1 cup rolled oats (150 cal, 5g protein)
- 1/4 cup almond butter or peanut butter (protein + healthy fats)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon (optional)
- 1/4 tsp salt
- Optional: Mix-ins (chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit)

**Directions:**
1. **Mix wet:** Mash bananas thoroughly (no chunks), add eggs + almond butter + vanilla.
2. **Mix dry:** Protein powder + oats + baking powder + cinnamon + salt.
3. **Combine:** Whisk dry into wet, mix just until combined (don't overmix).
4. **Chill dough:** Refrigerate 30 min (helps cookies hold shape + prevents spreading too much).
5. **Preheat:** 350°F (175°C).
6. **Scoop:** Form ~2 tbsp each, roll into balls, place on lined baking sheet (parchment paper preferred).
7. **Flatten:** Press lightly with fork (cookies don't spread much on their own).
8. **Bake:** 10-13 min until edges golden brown.
9. **Cool:** On baking sheet 2-3 min, then transfer to cooling rack.
10. **Store** in fridge (1 week) or freezer (3 months).

## Flavor Variations

### Chocolate Peanut Butter
- Vanilla or chocolate protein powder
- Add 1/4 cup chocolate chips

### Cinnamon Raisin Protein Cookies
- Vanilla protein powder + extra cinnamon (1 tsp)
- Add 1/2 cup raisins (add sweetness)

### Oatmeal Raisin (Classic)
- Vanilla protein powder
- Add 1/2 cup raisins + 1/4 cup walnuts

### Trail Mix Cookie
- Vanilla protein powder
- Add 1/4 cup each: dried cranberries + nuts + chocolate chips

### Chocolate Chip (Simple)
- Chocolate protein powder or vanilla + 2 tbsp cocoa powder
- Add 1/3-1/2 cup chocolate chips (more = more indulgent)

### PB & J Variation
- Vanilla protein powder + peanut butter (increase to 1/3 cup)
- Add 1/4 cup dried strawberries or strawberry jam chunks

## Serving Options

**As snack:**
- **1 cookie:** 12g protein, substantial snack
- **2 cookies:** 24g protein, meal replacement if you can't eat a full meal
- **With milk:** Adds 8g more protein + calcium

**As breakfast-on-the-go:**
- 2 cookies + milk = 32g protein (legitimate breakfast)
- Better than skipping breakfast or fast food
- Grab on way out the door

**Post-workout:**
- 1-2 cookies + whey protein shake = 32-44g protein
- Portable for gym bag/workout sessions

## Freezing & Storage

**Freezing (primary storage method):**
- Cool cookies completely (critical).
- Place 2 cookies per freezer bag (single serving portions).
- Freeze flat (maximizes freezer space).
- Freeze up to 3 months.
- Thaw: 5 min at room temp or eat slightly frozen.

**Refrigerator storage:**
- Store in airtight container.
- Lasts up to 1 week.
- Best texture within 3-4 days.

**Room temp:**
- OK for 1-2 days maximum
- Moisture from bananas = spoil faster than regular cookies
- Refrigerator or freezer is preferred

## Troubleshooting

**Cookies too dry/cakey:**
- Add 1 tbsp milk or applesauce to dough
- Don't overbake (check at 10 min).
- Oats may need to be slightly finer (pulse oats 5 seconds in blender).

**Cookies too sticky/wet:**
- Add 1-2 tbsp additional oats.
- Chill dough longer (45-60 min).
- Bake slightly longer (up to 15 min).

**Cookies spread too much:**
- Dough needs more chilling (30 min minimum).
- Baking sheet too hot (cool 5 min between batches).
- Reduce baking powder slightly (use 1/4 tsp instead of 1/2 tsp).

**Flavor too banana-forward:**
- Increase protein powder to 1.5 scoops (dilutes banana taste).
- Add more mix-ins (chocolate chips, nuts, etc.).
- Replace some banana with unsweetened applesauce (if you dislike banana).

## Protein Powder Choices

**What works:**
- **Vanilla whey:** Classic, light flavor
- **Chocolate whey:** Rich, good with PB variations
- **Vanilla casein:** Slightly more cake-like texture
- **Unflavored whey:** Base for flavor experimentation

**What doesn't work as well:**
- **Plant protein:** Different texture (more dense/chewy)
- **Unsweetened stevia-only powder:** Not as tasty, requires extra sweetener
- **Collagen powder:** Doesn't firm cookies as well

**Recommendation:**
- Vanilla whey for most versatility
- Chocolate whey for chocolate/PB variations
- If plant protein only: Expect denser, slightly drier

## Portion Mindset

**Pre-GLP-1:**
- "One cookie? I'll eat 3-4, let's be honest."
- Cookies are junk food snacks, not meals.

**GLP-1 reality:**
- **1 cookie** = substantial snack (12g protein)
- **2 cookies** = small meal (24g protein)
- **3 cookies** = meal with moderate calories (600 cal)
- Appetite naturally limits you to 1-2 max

**Comparison to regular cookies:**
- Regular chocolate chip: 2-3g protein, 150-200 cal
- Protein cookie: 12g protein, 200-250 cal
- 2 regular cookies vs 1 protein cookie = similar calories, way more protein

> [!WARNING] Watch banana ripeness
- **Perfect ripe:** Yellow with some brown spots = sweetest, best flavor
- **Under-ripe:** Very yellow/green = less sweet, less moisture = drier cookies
- **Over-ripe:** Brown/dark spots = very soft, may make cookies too wet

> [!NOTE] Oats in cookies = fiber + sustained energy
- Oats provide complex carbs + fiber
- Not like white flour alone (spike/crash energy pattern)
- Sustained release = steadier energy, less sugar crash

> [!BONUS] Cookie dough is edible (no eggs risk IF you use pasteurized eggs)
- Traditional cookie dough not safe (raw eggs).
- THIS dough: Pasteurized eggs + no egg risk OR skip eggs (adjust slightly - need 1 tbsp milk for moisture).
- BUT taste test pre-bake = not the point (you're eating protein, not dough anyway)

> [!TIP] Mix protein powder into dry oats FIRST
> Then add hot water/milk. No clumps, perfect texture.

## Why this works
Oats are comfort food. Adding protein powder turns it into a legit meal. Freeze individual portions for grab-and-go.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup rolled oats (150 cal, 5g protein)
- 1 scoop vanilla or unflavored protein powder (120 cal, 20g protein)
- 1 cup water or unsweetened almond milk (0-40 cal)
- Dash of cinnamon
- Optional: 1 tbsp nut butter or small handful nuts

## Directions
1. Mix dry oats + protein powder + cinnamon in a bowl.
2. Add boiling water/milk. Stir immediately to avoid clumps.
3. Let sit 2-3 minutes.
4. Top with nuts if adding calories.

## Meal Prep Version (Frozen)
1. Make a batch (4-5 servings) using water.
2. Portion into silicone muffin cups.
3. Freeze.
4. Reheat by microwaving 60-90 seconds + splash of milk.

## Low-Nausea Version
- Use warm, not hot, water.
- Skip cinnamon if smells trigger nausea.
- Keep it bland—oats + protein powder + water only.

> [!NOTE] Oat varieties
- Rolled oats: Standard, good texture balance.
- Instant oats: Faster, can get mushy.
- Steel-cut oats: Chewy, longer cook time (not recommended for quick version).

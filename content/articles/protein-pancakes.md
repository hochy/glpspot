> [!TIP] Double the recipe
- This recipe makes 6 pancakes (3 per serving).
- Double for 12 pancakes. Freeze in 3-pint bags for grab-and-go breakfasts.

## Why this works
Pancakes = comfort food. But GLP-1 reality means you can't eat a stack of 8. These are dense: 3 small pancakes = legitimate meal. Freeze and reheat.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup rolled oats (150 cal, 5g protein)
- 1 scoop protein powder (vanilla or unflavored, 120 cal, 20g protein)
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 1 egg (70 cal, 6g protein)
- 3/4 cup milk (almond, oat, or regular - adds 0-100 cal)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Optional: 1 tbsp coconut oil or butter for cooking

## Directions
1. Blend oats to flour consistency (30 seconds).
2. Mix oat flour + protein powder + baking powder + cinnamon.
3. Whisk egg + milk + vanilla.
4. Combine wet + dry ingredients. Mix until just combined (don't overmix).
5. Heat skillet to medium-low. Coat with oil if using.
6. Pour small scoops (2 tbsp each). Cook 2-3 minutes per side.
7. Transfer to cooling rack.

## Freezing & Reheating
- **Freeze:** Once cool, stack 3 pancakes per bag. Freeze up to 3 months.
- **Reheat:** Microwave 60 seconds. Or toast at 350°F for 5 minutes.

## Serving Ideas
- **Pure:** Just pancakes (good for low appetite).
- **With fruit:** 1/2 cup berries (adds sweetness + antioxidants).
- **With nut butter:** 1 tbsp for extra calories + healthy fats.
- **With syrup:** Real maple syrup (protein pancakes soak up less, use sparingly).

## Flavor Variations
- **Chocolate:** Add 1 tbsp cocoa powder to dry mix.
- **Blueberry:** Fold in 1/2 cup blueberries before cooking.
- **Banana:** Mash 1/2 banana into the batter.
- **Pumpkin:** Add 1/4 cup pumpkin puree + extra pumpkin pie spice.

> [!WARNING] Watch the size
- These aren't restaurant-sized pancakes. Make them small (3-4 inches diameter).
- You want dense nutrition, not volume. 3 small pancakes = meal.

> [!NOTE] Protein powder taste
- Vanilla powder = sweet, dessert-like.
- Unflavored = neutral, savory option works for all.
- Chocolate = good dessert version, can taste artificial if cheap.

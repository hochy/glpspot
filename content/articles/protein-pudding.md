> [!TIP] Make it ahead
- This sets firmer in the fridge.
- Make at night, breakfast is waiting. Or prep at start of week.

## Why this works
GLP-1 doesn't kill your sweet tooth—it just shrinks your appetite. This satisfies sugar cravings while delivering dense protein. No sugar crash afterward.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup Greek yogurt or cottage cheese (25g protein)
- 1 scoop protein powder (vanilla or chocolate)
- 1 tbsp cocoa powder (if using vanilla protein for chocolate flavor)
- Optional: Sweetener (stevia, monk fruit, or 1 tsp honey)
- Optional: 1 tsp peanut butter or almond butter (swirl in on top)

## Directions
1. Add yogurt/cottage cheese to bowl.
2. Add protein powder (+ cocoa if using).
3. Mix thoroughly until smooth.
4. Sweeten to taste (start small).
5. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes (helps thicken).
6. Top with nut butter swirl if desired.

## Flavor Variations

### Cookie Dough Protein Pudding

## Texture Hacks
- **Firmer:** Refrigerate 2+ hours. More set, like cheesecake.
- **Softer:** Eat immediately. Mousse texture.
- **Blended:** Blend all ingredients 30 seconds. Smoother.

## Sweetener Guide
| Sweetener | Taste | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Stevia drops | No calories | Strong taste, use sparingly |
| Monk fruit | No calories | Cleaner taste than stevia |
| Honey | Real sugar | 1 tsp = 20 cal, use wisely |
| Maple syrup | Real sugar | 1 tbsp = 52 cal, treat as dessert |

> [!WARNING] Cottage cheese texture
- Unblended cottage cheese = lumpy texture.
- Blend 30 seconds first if texture bothers you.
- Or use Greek yogurt (smooth texture).

> [!NOTE] Protein powder breakdown
- Whey: Thicker, creamier pudding.
- Casein: Thicker, sets more like cheesecake.
- Plant protein: Often thinner, experiment with brands.

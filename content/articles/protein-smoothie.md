> [!TIP] Liquid nutrition hack
> When appetite or nausea is bad, liquids go down easier. Don't fight it—work with it.

## Why this works
GLP-1 side effects like nausea and early satiety make solid food tough. This smoothie delivers dense nutrition in a format your body tolerates.

## Ingredients
- 1 scoop whey or casein protein powder (20-25g protein)
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk or oat milk (30-40 cal)
- 1/2 cup frozen berries (optional, for flavor)
- 1 tbsp peanut butter or almond butter (90 cal, 4g protein)
- Ice cubes (for texture without volume)

## Directions
1. Add protein powder + milk to blender.
2. Add nut butter + berries (if using).
3. Blend until smooth.
4. Add ice if you want it thicker.
5. Drink immediately.

## Variations
- **Pure protein version:** Skip berries and nut butter. Just protein + water/milk.
- **Calorie boost:** Add 1 tbsp coconut oil or MCT oil.
- **Electrolytes:** Add a pinch of salt (tastes better than you think, helps hydration).

> [!NOTE] Protein powder hacks
> Whey absorbs fast (good post-workout or morning). Casein is slower (better before bed or for nausea).

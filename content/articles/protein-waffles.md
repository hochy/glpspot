> [!TIP] Double the batch
- Make 8 waffles at once, freeze in 2-waffle portions
- Reheat from frozen in 90 seconds (microwave or toaster)
- Breakfast for the week without daily cooking

## Why This Works

**Protein waffle advantages:**
- **Comfort food:** Waffles feel indulgent, not "diet food"
- **Freezable:** Microwave 90 sec from frozen
- **Protein-dense:** 20g per meal (2 waffles) = legitimate breakfast or snack
- **Versatile toppings:** Sweet or savory options
- **Portable:** Reheated, eat in car/at desk

**GLP-1 specific:**
- 2 waffles = manageable portion (not 4-6 like restaurant)
- Freeze in batches = reduce daily cooking effort
- Sweet cravings satisfied with protein, not junk food

## Base Recipe

**Ingredients (makes 4 waffles):**
- 1 cup rolled oats (150 cal, 5g protein)
- 2 eggs (12g protein, 140 cal)
- 1 scoop protein powder (vanilla, 120 cal, 20g protein)
- 1/2 tsp baking powder (leavening)
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon (optional)
- 1/4 cup milk (almond milk, oat milk, or regular - adds 0-40 cal)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Optional: 2 tbsp sweetener (honey, maple syrup, stevia)
- Oil for waffle iron (1 tsp spray or wipe with paper towel)

**Directions:**
1. **Oat flour:** Blend oats to flour consistency (30 seconds).
2. **Mix dry:** Oat flour + protein powder + baking powder + cinnamon.
3. **Mix wet:** Protein powder already in dry + eggs + milk + vanilla.
4. **Combine:** Whisk wet into dry, mix just until combined (don't overmix).
5. **Rest:** Let batter sit 5 minutes (allows oats to absorb liquid).
6. **Cook:** Heat waffle iron, lightly oil, pour batter, cook 3-5 min per waffle (until golden).
7. **Cool:** Transfer to cooling rack (prevents soggy bottoms).
8. **Serve** immediately OR freeze for later.

## Flavor Variations

### Classic Vanilla
- Vanilla protein powder + cinnamon
- Top with berries + small drizzle maple syrup

### Chocolate Protein Waffles
- Chocolate protein powder + 1 tbsp cocoa powder
- Top with greek yogurt + few chocolate chips

### Peanut Butter Banana
- Vanilla protein powder
- Mash 1/2 banana into batter
- Top with peanut butter swirl

### Cinnamon Crunch
- Vanilla protein powder + 1.5 tsp cinnamon + 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- Top with almond butter

### Savory Waffles
- Unflavored protein powder + no sweetener
- Add 1/2 cup shredded cheese + chives
- Top with poached egg (adds 6g more protein = 26g total protein)

## Topping Ideas

**Protein-focused:**
- **Greek yogurt:** 1/2 cup = 12g protein (20g waffle + 12g yogurt = 32g total)
- **Cottage cheese:** 1/4 cup = 6g protein
- **Nut butter:** 1 tbsp peanut/almond butter (adds 90 cal + flavor)

**Sweet (calorie-conscious):**
- **Berries:** 1/2 cup fresh or frozen (25-50 cal)
- **Stevia drops:** sweetness without calories
- **Small maple syrup drizzle:** 1 tsp = 20 cal (reasonable)

**Savory:**
- **Poached egg:** 6g protein + rich yolk
- **Avocado:** 1/4 sliced = 60 cal + healthy fats
- **Cheese:** 1 oz shredded = 7g protein + 100 cal

## Freezing & Reheating

**Freezing:**
- Cool waffles completely (critical step - moisture ruins texture).
- Stack 2 waffles (one serving) per freezer bag.
- Freeze flat (maximizes freezer space).
- Good for 3 months in freezer.

**Reheating from frozen:**
- **Microwave:** 90 seconds on high, flip, another 60 sec = done.
- **Toaster oven:** 2-3 min at 350°F (crispier texture).
- **Regular toaster:** 2-3 min (some toaster handles frozen fine, others don't - test yours).
- **Air fryer:** 3-4 min at 350°F (excellent texture).

**Reheating from fridge (fresh):**
- **Microwave:** 30-45 seconds = warm, not crispy.
- **Toaster:** 1-2 minutes = crispy.

## Troubleshooting

**Waffles stick to iron:**
- Light oil is non-negotiable (use spray or wipe with oil on paper towel).
- Let batter rest 5 min (makes it less sticky).
- Don't open iron too early (waffle not set = tears).

**Batter too thick:**
- Add 1 tbsp milk at a time until pourable.
- Batter should be like thick pancake batter, not cookie dough.

**Batter too thin/runny:**
- Add 1 tbsp rolled oats at a time.
- Let sit longer (oats absorb = thickens).

**Waffles soggy after freezing:**
- Cool completely before freezing (critical).
- Reheat in toaster/air fryer for crispiness, not microwave alone.
- Microwave alone = soggy guaranteed.

## Protein Powder Choice

What works/doesn't:

| Protein Powder | Works? | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Vanilla whey | ✅ Yes | Fluffy, classic waffle texture |
| Vanilla casein | ✅ Yes | Slightly denser, holds shape well |
| Unflavored whey | ✅ Yes | Neutral, good base for any flavor |
| Chocolate whey | ✅ Yes | Good for chocolate version |
| Plant protein | ⚠️ Maybe | Texture differs, test first |
| Collagen powder | ❌ No | Doesn't firm waffles correctly |

**Recommendation:**
- Vanilla or unflavored whey for most versatile results
- Casein for slightly more cake-like texture
- If plant protein only: Expect denser, possibly chewier waffles

## Serving Sizes

**GLP-1 appropriate portions:**
- **2 waffles:** 20g protein, 350 cal (full meal)
- **1 waffle:** 10g protein, 175 cal (substantial snack)
- **3 waffles:** 30g protein, 525 cal (if appetite allows)

**Comparison to restaurant:**
- Restaurant Belgian waffle: 500-600 cal (mostly carbs/fat, low protein)
- Protein waffle: 350 cal, 20g protein (meal, not empty calories)

> [!WARNING] Don't overfill waffle iron
- Batter expands while cooking (overfill = mess)
- Pour halfway up iron edge (~1/2 batter capacity)
- Close gently (batter will spread).

> [!NOTE] Waffle iron temperature matters
- Preheat iron at least 5 min before first waffle
- Iron gets hotter as you cook (adjust time - last one cooks faster than first)
- Between batches: quick wipe with paper towel if needed.

> [!BONUS] Oats in waffles vs wheat flour
- Oats = complex carbs, fiber, whole grain (slow digestion, steady energy)
- Wheat flour = refined carbs (quick spike, crash)
- Oats = better satiety, better blood sugar regulation

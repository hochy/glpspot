> [!TIP] Buy pre-peeled deveined shrimp
- Saves 15+ minutes of prep work
- Worth the slight price premium
- Make cooking easier = more likely to cook

## Why This Works

**Shrimp advantages:**
- **Fast cooking:** 2-3 minutes per side (quickest protein to make)
- **Low calorie:** High protein with minimal calories (120-130 cal per 6 oz)
- **High protein:** 6 oz cooked shrimp = ~25g protein
- **Light:** Easier on stomach if appetite is low
- **Versatile:** Grill, pan-fry, bake, or boil

**GLP-1 perfect:**
- Quick = less time standing in kitchen
- 25g protein = legitimate meal size
- Low calorie = doesn't overwhelm smaller appetite

## Base Recipe

**Ingredients (for 2 servings/skewers):**
- 12-15 large shrimp (peeled, deveined, ~1 lb total)
- 1 tbsp olive oil or melted butter
- 1 tbsp lemon juice (fresh)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp fresh herbs (parsley, dill, or cilantro)
- Salt + pepper to taste
- Optional: Skewers (if grilling) - wooden, soaked 10 min first

**Directions:**
1. Thread shrimp onto skewers (3-4 per skewer).
2. Mix olive oil + lemon juice + garlic + herbs + salt + pepper.
3. Brush mixture over skewers.
4. **Grill** (preferred): Medium-high heat, 2-3 min per side.
5. **Pan-fry:** Hot skillet, 2-3 min per side.
6. **Oven bake:** 425°F for 8-10 min.
7. Done when shrimp turn pink/opaque (don't overcook - rubbery).

## Flavor Variations

### Garlic Lemon
- Olive oil + lemon juice + fresh garlic + parsley
- Classic, bright, fresh flavor

### Spicy Cajun
- Olive oil + Cajun seasoning blend
- Optional: Add red pepper flakes for extra heat

### Coconut Curry
- Coconut oil + curry powder + salt
- Serve with steamed broccoli or cauliflower rice

### Teriyaki
- Olive oil + soy sauce + ginger + garlic
- Lower teriyaki sauce (glaze at end, reduces sugar)

### Mediterranean
- Olive oil + oregano + lemon + garlic
- Serve with cucumber-tomato salad

## Serving Ideas

**Protein-focused meals:**
- **Shrimp + Steamed Broccoli:** 25g protein + fiber
- **Shrimp + Asparagus:** Classic combo
- **Shrimp + Salad Greens:** Quick protein salad
- **Shrimp + Zucchini Noodles:** Low-carb, volume from veggies

**With small starch:**
- **Shrimp + 1/2 Cup Quinoa:** Adds 100 cal + variety
- **Shrimp + Small Potato:** Roasted, ~150 cal
- **Shrimp + Brown Rice:** 1/4 cup = 50 cal

**Marinade hack:**
- Make double marinade: Use half for shrimp, reserve half for dipping sauce
- Don't reuse sauce that touched raw shrimp (food safety risk)

## Meal Prep Friendly

**Freezing:**
- Cooked shrimp freezes well (3 months freezer life)
- Cool completely before freezing
- Portion into 6 oz containers (approx 1 meal size)

**Reheating:**
- Microwave 60-90 sec (texture slightly rubbery)
- Cold in salad (totally fine)
- Better: Cook fresh for best texture

**Batch prep:**
- Buy 2 lbs shrimp = prep 4 meals at once
- Different marinades each day keeps it from getting boring

## Buying & Storing

**Fresh vs. Frozen:**
- **Frozen shrimp:** Often better quality (flash-frozen on boat)
- **Fresh shrimp:** Better if consumed same day
- **Thawing:** Fridge overnight or cold water bath for 15 min

**Storage:**
- **Fresh:** Use within 2 days or freeze
- **Frozen:** 3-6 months freezer
- **Cooked:** 3-4 days fridge, 3 months frozen

**Shrimp grades:**
- **Colossal:** 10-15 per lb (expensive, huge - 2 = meal)
- **Jumbo:** 15-20 per lb (good balance)
- **Large:** 20-25 per lb (more economical)
- **Medium:** 25-30 per lb (smaller, more to eat)

> [!WARNING] Don't overcook
- Shrimp turns rubbery fast (overcook by 1-2 min = bad texture)
- Color change: translucent → pink/white = done
- Test: One shrimp - cuts easily, doesn't resist = perfect

> [!NOTE] Seasoning on shrimp doesn't penetrate much
- Marinades coat the surface (not deep flavor)
- That's fine - glaze/sauce provides most flavor
- Focus on quick cooking vs. long marination

> [!BONUS] Shrimp are low-calorie protein
- 6 oz shrimp = 6 oz steak
- Steak: 400 cal (25g protein, 30g fat)
- Shrimp: 120 cal (25g protein, 2g fat)
- Same protein, way fewer calories

> [!TIP] Not everyone experiences this
- Sleep issues are a possible, not guaranteed, side effect
- ~20-30% of users report some sleep disruption
- Usually improves as body adjusts to medication

## What's Happening

### Why GLP-1s Affect Sleep

**GLP-1 receptors exist in the brain:**
- They're not just in the pancreas/digestive system
- Found in hypothalamus (regulates appetite, sleep-wake cycles)
- Medication crosses blood-brain barrier in some people

**Possible mechanisms:**
- **Altered circadian rhythm:** GLP-1 affects hypothalamic signaling
- **Reduced REM sleep:** Shorter REM phase = vivid, memorable dreams
- **Nighttime hunger:** Some people wake up hungry (navigating food restriction)
- **Anxiety/stress:** Rapid weight loss + new body = psychological disruption
- **Medication timing:** Taking doses too close to bedtime affects some users

## Common Sleep Complaints

### "I fall asleep fine, but wake up 3 AM"
**What's happening:**
- Sleep maintenance insomnia (stay asleep is the problem)
- May be related to GLP-1 receptor effects on hypothalamus
- Or cortisol/stress response to rapid changes

**Strategies:**
- Check if you're hungry (small protein snack may help)
- Don't clock-watch (makes anxiety worse)
- If awake >20 min: Get up, do something boring, return to bed when sleepy
- Avoid screens during wakefulness (blue light suppresses melatonin)

### "I have incredibly vivid, disturbing dreams"
**What's happening:**
- GLP-1s can reduce REM sleep duration
- Shorter REM = more concentrated, memorable dreams
- Dreams feel more vivid/real because brain cycles differently

**Strategies:**
- Expect this to improve as body adjusts (usually 4-8 weeks)
- Before bed: Avoid stimulating content (news, violent media)
- Keep a dream journal (processing sometimes reduces emotional intensity)
- If nightmares are severe: Talk to doctor about dose timing/adjustment

### "I can't fall asleep at all"
**What's happening:**
- Sleep onset insomnia
- Could be medication side effect OR anxiety about rapid changes
- Or combination of both

**Strategies:**
- Check medication timing (most people take morning, night dosing = more insomnia)
- Before bed: Reduce blue light screens 1-2 hours prior
- Routine: Same bedtime every night, same wake time (train body rhythm)
- Supplements: Magnesium glycinate 400mg before bed (consult doctor first)

### "I'm sleeping but waking up exhausted"
**What's happening:**
- Sleep fragmentation (waking briefly multiple times)
- Quality > quantity: You may be asleep but not getting deep/REM phases
- Weight loss itself can cause temporary fatigue (body adjusting)

**What to check:**
- Sleep apnea: Weight loss can improve, but snoring still happens
- Sleep disorders: If exhausted despite "adequate" hours → see doctor
- Protein intake: Low protein + weight loss = no repair/recovery = fatigue

## Sleep Hygiene Basics (Non-GLP-Specific)

Because GLP-1s can disrupt sleep, optimize everything else:

### Environment
- Cool bedroom: 65-68°F (helps body temperature drop = sleep onset)
- Dark room: Blackout curtains, eye mask
- Quiet: White noise machine, earplugs

### Timing
- Bedtime window: Same 30-minute window nightly
- Wake time: Consistent daily (even weekends)
- Naps: <20 minutes, before 3 PM (don't ruin nighttime sleep)

### Before Bed
- **1 hour before:** Avoid screens (phones, TV, computers)
- **2 hours before:** Heavy meals, large snacks (digestion = wakefulness)
- **3 hours before:** Caffeine (coffee, tea, soda)
- **4 hours before:** Alcohol (makes you sleepy but ruins sleep quality)

### Morning Routine
- **Immediately:** Get sunlight exposure (regulates circadian rhythm)
- Within 30 min: Protein-rich breakfast, caffeine
- Exercise: Morning > afternoon > evening (exercise raises alertness)

## Medication Timing Hack

**This helps some users:**

| When You Take It | How It Affects Sleep |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Morning (7-9 AM) | Least sleep disruption for most |
| Mid-day (11 AM-1 PM) | Some report mid-afternoon insomnia |
| Evening (6-8 PM) | Worst for sleep - don't do this |

**Why morning is best:**
- Medication is active when your body's naturally awake
- Effects taper off by bedtime
- aligns with circadian rhythm optimization

**If morning doesn't help:**
- Try shifting earlier (6AM vs 8AM)
- Or slightly earlier/later within morning window
- Everyone responds differently - some experimentation

## When to See a Doctor

See your prescribing doctor if:
- Sleep issues persist >4 weeks despite sleep hygiene
- Insomnia is affecting daily functioning (work, safety driving)
- Daytime fatigue is dangerous (falling asleep driving, etc.)
- You're using sleep aids not prescribed by doctor (risk of interactions)
- You're experiencing racing thoughts, panic, or severe anxiety

**Medical options:**
- Dose adjustment (lower dose, different timing)
- Different GLP-1 medication (semaglutide vs tirzepatide affects people differently)
- Sleep medication (short-term, under doctor supervision)
- Counseling/therapy (if anxiety/stress is primary driver)

## The Reality: This Usually Improves

**Timeline:**
- **Weeks 1-4:** Sleep disruption most common (body adapting)
- **Weeks 4-8:** Some users see improvement
- **Weeks 8+:** Most stabilize, sleep improves OR they adapt to "new normal"

**What "improvement" looks like:**
- Not necessarily perfect sleep pre-GLP-1
- Manageable, restful sleep even if not "perfect"
- Dreams may still be vivid but less disturbing
- Waking up at night becomes rare, manageable

**The GLP-1 tradeoff conversation:**
- Weight loss benefits vs. sleep disruption
- Sleep affects mood, energy, long-term health
- If severe: Ask doctor about dose, timing, medication change

> [!WARNING] Don't use untested sleep supplements
- Melatonin: Generally safe, but talk to doctor first (can interact)
- Prescription sleep aids: Only under doctor supervision
- Over-the-counter: Valerian, chamomile may help but limited evidence

> [!NOTE] Caffeine sensitivity increases on GLP-1s
- You may notice caffeine affects you more strongly
- Same coffee you drank for years = now causing insomnia
- Try reducing caffeine first before blaming medication alone

> [!BONUS] Exercise improves sleep
- Morning/daytime exercise = better sleep that night
- BUT: Exercise within 3 hours of bedtime = worse sleep
- Sweet spot: Morning or afternoon, not late evening

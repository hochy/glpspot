> [!TIP] Stock tuna in pantry
- Canned tuna has 2-3 year shelf life.
- Always have protein available without grocery trips.

## Why this works
Zero cooking required. Shelf-stable. High protein. Eat alone, on crackers, or with cucumber slices.

## Ingredients
- 1 can (5 oz) tuna in water (drained) - 25g protein
- 1-2 tbsp mayonnaise or Greek yogurt
- Optional: 1 tbsp relish, mustard, celery, onion
- Salt + pepper to taste

## Directions
1. Drain tuna thoroughly.
2. Add mayo/yogurt + seasonings.
3. Mix to desired consistency.
4. Eat immediately or refrigerate.

## Serving Options
- **Standalone:** With a fork (2-3 bites suffices).
- **Crackers:** 4-6 whole wheat crackers.
- **Cucumber cups:** Hollow out cucumber, fill with tuna.
- **Lettuce wraps:** Large butter lettuce leaves.

## Flavor Variations
- **Classic:** Mayo + relish + mustard.
- **Greek yogurt version:** Greek yogurt + dill + lemon.
- **Spicy:** Mayo + hot sauce + cayenne.
- **Simple:** Just mayonnaise + salt + pepper (for sensitive stomach).

> [!WARNING] Watch mercury intake
- Canned light tuna is lower in mercury than albacore.
- Limit to 2-3 cans/week max.
- Rotate with other protein sources (eggs, chicken, protein powder).

> [!NOTE] Canned vs pouch
- Pouch tuna: No draining, slightly more expensive.
- Canned: Cheaper, requires draining. Same protein.

> [!TIP] Smaller is better on GLP-1
- Make 4 oz patties, not 6 oz.
- You'll finish it comfortably, no food waste.

## Why this works
Burger = comfort food. But GLP-1 reality means a restaurant quarter-pounder is overwhelming. This turkey burger is protein-dense, lower fat, manageable portion.

## Base Recipe
**Ingredients (for 4 burgers):**
- 1 lb ground turkey (93% lean or higher - 25g protein per 4 oz)
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs or oats (binds moisture)
- 1 egg (6g protein, binds)
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce (flavor)
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

**Directions:**
1. Mix all ingredients in bowl (don't overmix).
2. Form 4 patties (don't pack too tight - makes them tough).
3. Make indentation in center of each patty (prevents puffing).
4. Grill or pan fry over medium-high heat 4-6 minutes per side.
5. Internal temp should reach 165°F.
6. Let rest 2 minutes before serving.

## Serving Options

### No-Bun
- Just burger + fork (GLP-1 perfect portion).
- Or wrap in large lettuce leaf.

### Bun Option (if you can handle it)
- Whole wheat bun (adds 100-150 calories).
- Toast bun first (better texture).
- Open-faced = half bun, easier to eat.

### Flavor Toppings
- **Classic:** Cheddar cheese + tomato + lettuce
- **Bacon Lover:** 2 slices turkey bacon + cheddar
- **Guacamole:** 1/4 avocado (adds healthy fat)
- **Mushroom:** Sautéed mushrooms + swiss cheese
- **Jalapeño:** Pickled jalapeños + pepper jack

## Side Dishes (keep it simple)
- **Green:** Side salad with light dressing
- **Veggie:** Roasted broccoli or asparagus
- **Starch:** Small portion roasted sweet potato

## Freezer Option
- Cook patties, cool completely, freeze in freezer bags.
- Reheat: Microwave 90 seconds or air fry.
- Good for 3 months in freezer.

> [!WARNING] Turkey dryness
- White meat turkey (99% lean) can be dry.
- 93% lean has enough fat to stay moist.
- If using 99%, add 1 tbsp olive oil or mayo to mixture.

> [!NOTE] Don't overcook
- Turkey doesn't need to be well-done like beef.
- 165°F = safe. Going higher = dry, tough burger.
- Use meat thermometer - better than guessing.

> [!BONUS] Make 8 mini sliders
- Form 8 small 2 oz patties.
- 2 mini sliders = 1 burger feel.
- Easier to eat, feels like bigger portion.

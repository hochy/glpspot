> [!TIP] The ‘two-rollup minimum’
> If you can do two rollups, you’ve anchored your day with protein.

## Ingredients
- 4–6 slices deli turkey (or chicken)
- 2 slices cheese (or 1/2 cup cottage cheese on the side)
- Optional: mustard, pickles, cucumber slices, lettuce

## Directions
1. Lay turkey slices flat.
2. Add cheese + a smear of mustard.
3. Roll up and eat.

## GLP-1 friendly notes
- Keep portions small; you can always make a second batch.
- If you get "stuck" chewing, switch to cottage cheese / yogurt style proteins.

> [!WARNING] If swallowing feels difficult
> Don’t force it — switch to softer foods and hydrate. If it’s persistent, check in with your clinician.

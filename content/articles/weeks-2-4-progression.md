# Weeks 2-4: What to Expect as Your Dose Increases

You survived week 1. You've figured out protein portions, you're staying hydrated, and you're starting to understand your new relationship with food.

Now comes the interesting part: weeks 2-4. This is when things really shift.

## The Dose Ramps Up

Most GLP-1 protocols increase your dose every 4 weeks. By weeks 2-4, you may be transitioning to your second dose level (often 0.5mg for Ozempic, 2.5mg for Mounjaro).

**What this means for you:**
- Appetite suppression intensifies
- Side effects may return (usually milder than week 1)
- Your "new normal" keeps shifting
- Food preferences continue to evolve

## Appetite: The Second Drop

Week 1 reduced your appetite. Weeks 2-4 suppress it even further.

**What you might notice:**
- Food has even less appeal
- You're forgetting to eat entirely
- The idea of a "meal" feels overwhelming
- Only specific foods sound good at all

**This is normal.** Your brain is relearning hunger signals, and it takes time.

## Common Week 2-4 Experiences

### 1. The "I Forgot to Eat" Phase

By week 2-3, many people look at the clock and realize "Oh, it's 4pm and I haven't eaten."

**The problem:** This is when metabolism protests. Your body needs fuel, GLP-1 or not.

**The solution:** Set gentle structure. Not rigid meal times, but check-in points:
- Morning: Did you eat protein?
- Midday: Did you eat protein?
- Evening: Did you eat protein?

Protein is the anchor. If nothing else hits, protein does.

### 2. Food Aversion Intensifies

Cravings aren't just gone—they're often reversed. Foods you loved might suddenly sound gross, while bland things you never cared about become your go-to.

**Common shifts:**
- Sweets lose appeal (this one sticks for many)
- High-fat foods feel heavy
- Spicy foods trigger nausea
- Cold foods sound better than hot

**Pro tip:** Don't force foods that disgust you. Work WITH your preferences, not against them.

### 3. The "What Do I Eat?" Spiral

As appetite shrinks, the food world feels complicated by design. Restaurants are overwhelming. Grocery trips take forever.

**Simplify your approach:**
- Find 5-7 protein staples you tolerate well
- Rotate through them
- Don't overcomplicate it

You'll expand later. For now, survival mode with nutrition > gourmet meals.

### 4. Social Eating Awkwardness

By weeks 3-4, people notice. Friends ask "Are you eating?" Restaurants feel wrong.

**How to handle:**
- "I'm working with a nutritionist on portion control" (vague, true)
- "I've got a sensitive stomach lately, eating lightly"
- Order appetizers, share plates, or take home leftovers

You don't owe anyone an explanation about medication.

## Side Effects: Round 2

You thought you were done with nausea. Week 2 or 3 dose increase may bring it back—usually milder, but still annoying.

**Week 2-4 side effects to watch for:**
- Mild nausea (usually passes in 2-3 days)
- Fatigue (caloric deficit + body adapting)
- Constipation (less food intake = slower digestion)
- Occasional dizziness (electrolyte shifts)

**Managing round 2:**
- Return to week 1 basics temporarily (small portions, bland foods)
- Protein-first eating stays crucial
- Hydration stays non-negotiable
- Give yourself 48-72 hours before panic

## Protein: The Non-Negotiable Priority

This is where weeks 2-4 separate success from struggle.

**Your protein goal:**
- Still 60-80g daily for most people
- But now: much harder to hit naturally
- Smaller stomach = less capacity for big chicken breasts

**The week 2-4 protein strategy:**
- Go for density over volume (egg whites, protein powder)
- Snacks become legitimate meals (protein bites, shakes)
- Front-load protein (eat it when you're actually hungry)
- Use supplements liberally (protein powder, bars)

**Warning:** If you can't hit 60g of protein at your current appetite, your doctor needs to know. Protein malnutrition isn't worth rapid weight loss.

## Meal Structure Changes

Plate-sized meals aren't working anymore. What does?

### The "Munching" Approach
Forget sit-down meals. Eat small protein bits throughout the day:
- 10g protein at 9am
- 15g protein at 11am
- 20g protein at 2pm
- 15g protein at 5pm

Total: 60g protein, no giant meal required.

### The "Two-Fake-Thirds" Method
Divide your protein into two "meals" that are actually just big snacks:
- Morning: Greek yogurt + protein bite + egg white scramble (30g protein)
- Evening: Chicken + rice + vegetables (30g protein)

### The "Backup" Strategy
Always have liquid protein:
- Protein shake as an emergency fallback
- Protein water powder in your bag
- Broth with collagen

When solid food is impossible, liquid fills the gap.

## Navigating Weight Loss Velocity

Weeks 2-4 are often peak weight loss velocity.

**What to expect:**
- 1-3 lbs per week is common (sometimes more early on)
- Water weight drops fast initially
- Weight may fluctuate wildly (salt, TOM for women, sodium-sensitive foods)

**What NOT to do:**
- Compare yourself to others
- Panic if weeks stall
- Obsess over daily weigh-ins
- Cut calories further because "it's working"

**Healthy tracking:**
- Weigh once weekly (same day, same time)
- Focus on how you feel, not just the number
- Remember sustainable > rapid

## The Mental Game Intensifies

By weeks 3-4, the novelty fades and reality sets in.

**Common thoughts:**
- "Is this sustainable?"
- "Will I ever enjoy food again?"
- "Am I losing too fast?"
- "What happens when I stop?"

**Reality check:**
- Appetite partially returns over time (you don't stay this suppressed forever)
- Food enjoyment shifts, doesn't end
- You stabilize at a maintenance dose eventually (not zero appetite forever)
- Your brain adjusts just as your body does

## Week 2-4 Shopping List Adjustments

Your grocery cart needs to reflect lower appetite:

**Add:**
- Protein powder (vanilla, unflavored)
- Protein bars (for emergencies)
- Pre-cooked proteins
- Electrolytes
- More frozen portions

**Remove:**
- Family-size anything
- Bulk perishables (will rot)
- Foods that sounded good but now don't

**Pro tip:** Spend a bit more on convenience (pre-cut, pre-cooked). It's worth it to reduce food waste.

## When to Reach Out to Your Doctor

Weeks 2-4 are where problems surface.

**Contact your provider if:**
- You can't keep ANY food or fluids down for 24+ hours
- Protein intake drops below 40g daily consistently
- You're losing more than 4 lbs per week (excessive)
- Severe symptoms: fainting, uncontrolled vomiting, abdominal pain
- You're feeling deeply depressed or anxious about the food changes

Don't tough it out. There are dose adjustments and supportive care options.

## Looking Ahead to Months 2-3

By week 4, you're approaching maintenance thinking. But weeks 5-12 bring:
- More dose increases (depending on your titration schedule)
- Appetite stabilization (less suppression over time)
- Finding your sustainable "new normal"
- The plateau phase (when weight slows)

You're building habits now that need to work long-term. Keep that in mind.

## Week 2-4 Checklist

✅ Protein tracking (hit 60g daily minimum)  
✅ Hydration (80-96oz water + electrolytes)  
✅ Gentle eating structure (not rigid, but consistent)  
✅ Backup protein (shakes, bars for impossible days)  
✅ Weekly weigh-ins (not daily)  
✅ Side effect monitoring (what's normal vs. red flag)  
✅ Social strategies (how to handle eating around people)  

## The Bottom Line

Weeks 2-4 are the middle miles. The novelty of week 1 is gone, but you haven't reached your new normal yet. Appetite keeps dropping, side effects may return, and the food world feels complicated.

**Remember:**
- Protein is your anchor—never compromise
- Hydration is your shield—always prioritize
- Small, frequent eating beats giant meals
- This is temporary adjustment, not permanent disability
- You CAN navigate this successfully

You made it through week 1. You can do weeks 2-4. And by week 4, you'll have systems in place that will serve you throughout your entire GLP-1 journey.

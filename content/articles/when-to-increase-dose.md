# When to Increase Your GLP-1 Dose

GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro don't work at full strength immediately. They're typically started low and increased gradually — a process called titration.

But how do you know when it's time to increase? What are you supposed to watch for? And what should prompt a phone call to your doctor instead of just waiting for the next scheduled increase?

---

## The Typical Titration Schedule

Standard protocol varies by medication and doctor preference, but generally looks like:

**Wegovy (Semaglutide):**
- Start: 0.25 mg/week
- Increase monthly: 0.25 → 0.5 → 1.0 → 1.7 → 2.4 mg (or max)

**Ozempic:**
- Start: 0.25 mg/week
- Increase monthly: 0.25 → 0.5 → 1.0 → 2.0 mg (or maximum your doctor considers appropriate)

**Zepbound (Tirzepatide):**
- Start: 2.5 mg/week
- Increase monthly: 2.5 → 5 → 7.5 → 10 → 12.5 → 15 mg (max)

**Mounjaro:**
- Start: 2.5 mg/week
- Increase monthly: 2.5 → 5 → 7.5 → 10 → 12.5 → 15 mg (max)

Every doctor adjusts this. Some go slower, some go faster. Some skip doses. Your doctor creates a plan for YOU.

## What Your Doctor Is Checking Before Increases

Between dose increases, doctors want to know:

**1. How are you tolerating the current dose?**
- Nausea severity and frequency
- Any vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation
- Fatigue, energy levels

**2. How much hunger suppression are you experiencing?**
- Some suppression = normal
- Too much suppression = not eating enough = risk
- Not enough suppression = dose might need to be higher (or other factors checked)

**3. How is your weight progressing?**
- Are you still losing?
- Has weight loss slowed significantly?
- Are you at your goal weight?

**4. Any new side effects?**
- Gallbladder issues
- Hair loss
- Vision changes (rare but serious)

## Signs It Might Be Time to Increase

These are generally green flags — things that suggest your body is tolerating the dose well and could benefit from more:

### ✅ You're tolerating the dose well
- No severe or frequent nausea
- Not vomiting, diarrhea manageable
- Energy is reasonable
- Side effects you DO have are mild

### ✅ You're still losing weight
- Not plateaued
- Weight loss is happening at a sustainable pace (not crashing fast)

### ✅ You're eating enough protein
- Consistently hitting your protein goal
- Not losing muscle (weight should be fat, not muscle)

### ✅ Your blood sugar is well-controlled (if diabetic)
- HbA1c at or near goal
- No dangerous lows or highs
- Doctor says: "You're on track"

### ✅ Your quality of life is improving
- Better sleep
- More energy
- Clothes fit better
- You feel like yourself

## Signs to Hold Off (or Call Your Doctor)

These aren't necessarily red flags — they're reasons to pause and reassess:

### ⚠️ Significant food aversion
- Protein has become difficult to choke down
- Strong aversion to foods you previously enjoyed
- Skipping meals frequently because you "just can't"

Your body might be saying: "Too much! Back off a bit."

### ⚠️ Severe or frequent nausea/vomiting
- Nausea prevents eating much of the time
- Vomiting multiple times a week

This affects hydration and calorie intake. Before increasing, address this.

### ⚠️ Severe constipation
- Not going for days
- Painful, uncomfortable
- Over-the-counter remedies aren't helping

Constipation means your body isn't processing as it should. Address this before dose increases.

### ⚠️ Fatigue is unmanageable
- Not just "I feel a bit tired"
- Can't function in daily life
- Interferes with relationships, work, routine

Fatigue at 2.5mg tirzepatide? Expected and manageable. Severe fatigue making life hard? Not okay.

### ⚠️ Hair loss that bothers you
- Mild hair loss is possible but not great for quality of life
- If it's affecting your self-image significantly, discuss before further increases

### ⚠️ Weight loss is NOT happening despite adequate protein intake
- You're hitting your protein goals
- Eating appropriate calories (not too low)
- But weight has stalled

This suggests other factors might be at play — your doctor should consider adjusting the plan.

## When to CALL Your Doctor Instead of Waiting

Between scheduled visits, contact your doctor if you experience:

### 🚨 Severe or concerning symptoms
- Vomiting more than 3-4 times in a week
- Diarrhea for more than 5-7 days
- Blood sugar readings that don't make sense or are concerning
- Vision problems (blurred vision, blind spots - get tested immediately)
- Severe abdominal pain (could be gallbladder)

### ⚠️ Side effects that suddenly worsen
- Nausea or constipation gets noticeably worse without dietary changes
- New side effect appears that worries you

### ⚠️ Mood changes
- Prolonged depression or suicidal thoughts
- Anxiety that interferes with life severely

## The "I Feel Like I Should Have Lost More Weight" Issue

It's common to think: "I've been on 2.5mg tirzepatide for 4 weeks, I've only lost X lbs. Should I increase now?"

Reality: Weight loss is rarely linear. It slows over time. Factors:

- Starting weight
- Genetic factors
- What you're actually eating (protein + overall calories)
- Activity level
- Sleep
- Stress management
- Where you are in your menstrual cycle (if applicable)

If you're in contact with your doctor regularly and they say: "You're where you should be," then... you're where you should be.

Weight loss can be slow. That doesn't mean the medication isn't working.

## What to Track Between Visits

Your doctor and YOU benefit when you track these things:

**Daily:**
- What you're eating (protein, approximate portions)
- Activity/movement
- How you're feeling overall

**Weekly:**
- Weight (at same time on same day, same conditions)
- Any new or worsening side effects

**Monthly:**
- Weight progress photos (optional but helpful)
- Measurements (waist, hips - optional)
- How clothes fit (practical way to track progress)

Bring these records to your appointments. They help.

## The Bottom Line

**Your doctor makes the final call about dose increases.** They have your full picture: lab work, previous medical history, other medications you're on, and their professional judgment.

Your role is to:
1. Track symptoms honestly
2. Communicate clearly about what you're experiencing
3. Raise concerns when they arise
4. Ask questions if you don't understand something

**Titration is about finding YOUR starting point — not rushing to maximum dose.**

Your body responds to medication uniquely. Some people do best on 0.5mg semaglutide. Some on 5mg. Some on 7.5mg tirzepatide. Some on 15mg.

The highest dose isn't the best dose. YOUR best dose is the one you're tolerating well with minimal side effects while achieving results that make you feel healthier and happier.

*Don't compare your titration speed to others'. Bodies respond differently. Some people need lower doses for months before moving up. Others might hit their sweet dose relatively quickly. There's no race. The goal is the right dose for YOU.*

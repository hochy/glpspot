# Newsletter #1: Welcome to The GLPSpot

Subject: Your GLP-1 journey starts here 🚀

---

Hi there,

If you're reading this, you're probably on (or considering) a GLP-1 medication like Ozempic, Wegovy, or Mounjaro.

And you probably have questions.

**"How much should I eat?"**
**"Will I lose muscle?"**
**"What do I actually eat when I'm not hungry?"**

The GLPSpot is here to help.

This isn't a diet site. It's not about restriction or deprivation. It's about working *with* your medication — leveraging that reduced appetite to build habits that stick.

**What you'll get from us:**
- ✅ Protein-first nutrition strategies
- ✅ Real restaurant navigation advice (no more anxiety about ordering)
- ✅ Recipes designed for smaller appetites
- ✅ Common side effect management
- ✅ Weekly tips you can actually use

**What you won't get:**
- ❌ Diet culture messaging
- ❌ Food guilt or shame
- ❌ Unrealistic restrictions
- ❌ Medical advice (you still have your doctor for that)

The focus is simple: **Protein first, eat when you're actually hungry, listen to your body.**

We'll send practical tips and recipes every week. Nothing overwhelming. Just guidance that respects where you are right now.

Reply anytime — I read every message.

To your health,

**The GLPSpot Team**

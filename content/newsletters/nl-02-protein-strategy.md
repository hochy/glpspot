# Newsletter #2: The 8-Week Protein Strategy

Subject: Don't lose muscle on GLP-1 🥩

---

One of the biggest fears people have about GLP-1 weight loss:

**"I'm going to lose muscle."**

You're right to be concerned. Rapid weight loss without adequate protein = muscle loss.

But here's the thing: **You can prevent this** with a simple strategy.

## The 8-Week Protein Protocol

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation (120g protein/day)**
- Prioritize protein in every meal
- Learn your go-to sources: eggs, chicken, fish, Greek yogurt, protein powder
- Don't worry about hitting the exact number — aim for "a lot more than you were eating"

**Weeks 3-4: Automation (130-140g protein/day)**
- Establish meal patterns
- Protein at breakfast (crucial)
- Protein in every snack
- Start tracking if you haven't (no apps needed, just a simple checklist)

**Weeks 5-8: Optimization (140-150g protein/day)**
- Refine portions
- Add protein supplementation strategically
- Adjust as your satiety gets stronger

## Quick Protein Wins

- **Breakfast:** 3-egg scramble + cheese = 25g protein
- **Snack:** Greek yogurt (170g) = 15g protein
- **Dinner:** Grilled chicken breast (150g) = 35g protein
- **Shake:** Protein powder (1 scoop) = 25g protein

Total: **100g** — you're almost there with regular meals.

## Why This Matters

After 8 weeks:
- ✅ Your protein intake is automatic (no thinking required)
- ✅ You've protected your muscle during weight loss
- ✅ You've built habits that serve you for life

**One final thing:** Protein + GLP-1 = insane satiety.

When you hit 120g+ protein per day? You probably won't even *want* to overeat. The combination is powerful.

Try the protocol for one week. See how you feel.

# Newsletter #3: Restaurant Reality Check

Subject: 5 questions you'll actually get asked at restaurants 🍽

---

Social eating with friends? Family dinner? Business lunch?

These don't need to disappear from your life on GLP-1.

But conversations change. People *will* notice you're eating less. And they *will* comment.

Here are the 5 most common questions — and what to say.

## 1. "You're not eating much!"

**Keep it simple:** 
> "I've reduced my appetite naturally — feeling great with less." 

**If they push:** 
> "I'm actually quite satisfied." 

Then pivot: "How's the [project/job/life] going?" 

People rarely follow up when you redirect conversation.

## 2. "You've lost weight! What are you doing?"

**If you're comfortable sharing:**
> "I've been working with my doctor on a new approach. It's really helped."

**If you're not:**
> "Just been eating differently — lots of protein, smaller portions. Feeling good."

No explanation required. Not even a hint.

## 3. "One bite won't hurt!"

**This might be true, but your response is the same:**
> "I'm good, thank you."

Short. Polite. No justification.

If they keep pushing: "You're right, one bite won't hurt. But I've had enough."

## 4. "You should try [X food] — it's so good!"

**What they mean:** They want to share something with you.

**Your approach:** If you actually want to try a small bite, ask:
> "What's in it?" 

If it works with your plan: "Sounds great, I'll take a small portion."

If it doesn't: "That does sound amazing — you'll have to tell me how it is."

## 5. "You seem less... [joyful/engaged/yourself]"

**Oof. This one's real.** Weight loss brings commentary from people who don't know what's happening.

**If you're genuinely feeling good:**
> "I'm actually feeling better than I have in years."

**If there's truth to what they're saying:**
> "This is a big change, and I'm still adjusting. I appreciate you asking. I'll get there."

The pattern: **Keep it brief, redirect to conversation, don't over-explain.**

You don't owe anyone a dissertation on your medication. You don't have to justify boundaries. A kind, clear answer is sufficient.

**The people who matter will respect your answer.**

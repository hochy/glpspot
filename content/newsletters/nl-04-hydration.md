# Newsletter #4: The 7-Day Hydration Challenge

Subject: You're probably more dehydrated than you think 💧

---

Here's something most people on GLP-1 don't realize:

**You're losing more water than you think.**

Between reduced food intake (food contains water), increased urination from weight loss, and possible medication effects of GLP-1 drugs... dehydration creeps up.

Common symptoms you might mistake for something else:
- ⚡ Fatigue
- 🤬 Irritability
- 😴 "Afternoon energy crash"
- 🤢 Nausea

All can be dehydration in disguise.

## The 7-Day Hydration Challenge

**Day 1: The Morning Ritual**
- Drink 1 large glass of water (16-20 oz) first thing
- Before coffee. Before food.
- You'll be surprised at how good you feel.

**Day 2: The Pre-Meal Habit**
- Drink 1 small glass (8 oz) before every meal/snack
- This triggers satiety hormones before you even eat
- Reduces "how much do I actually want to eat" stress

**Day 3: The Water-First Rule**
- When you think you're hungry: drink water first
- Wait 15 minutes
- THEN decide if you're still hungry
- You'll be surprised how often the hunger... wasn't actually hunger

**Day 4: The Infused Water Experiment**
- Cold water: plain
- Warm water: add lemon
- Throughout the day: add cucumber slices or mint
- Find what you actually like

**Day 5: The Visible Tracker**
- Use a real water bottle with measurements
- Mark where you need to be by 12pm, 3pm, 7pm
- Visual accountability works

**Day 6: The "No Soda" Swap**
- Swap all sugary drinks for water
- Coffee? Black or with a splash of milk
- Tea? Unsweetened or water
- See how your energy changes

**Day 7: The "Enough" Test**
- Aim for half your body weight in ounces (150 lbs = 75 oz)
- Or about 2.5-3 liters total
- Notice: do you feel different?

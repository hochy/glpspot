# Newsletter #5: The Side Effect Trio

Subject: Nausea, Fatigue, Constipation — manage them all 💪

---

Most common GLP-1 side effects (besides reduced appetite):

1. Nausea
2. Fatigue/low energy
3. Constipation

These aren't inevitable. You can manage all three.

## Nausea Management

**Immediate (right now):**
- Sip warm water slowly (don't chug cold water)
- Ginger tea or ginger chews
- Eat small, frequent meals instead of big ones
- Avoid strong-smelling foods (triggers nausea)
- Stay upright 2-3 hours after eating

**Preventive (tomorrow and beyond):**
- Take your GLP-1 dose at night instead of morning (if doc approves)
- Eat something small and protein-rich before dose
- Fatty meals can worsen nausea — choose leaner options

## Fatigue Management

**Dietary:**
- More lean protein + healthy fats (avocados, nuts, olive oil)
- B-complex vitamin (ask your doc)
- Iron if labs show deficiency

**Lifestyle:**
- Morning light exposure (15-30 min outside) resets circadian rhythm
- Start gentle movement — doesn't have to be a gym session
- Hydrate first thing in morning (see last week's newsletter)

**Schedule:**
- Earlier bedtime (even 30 minutes makes a difference)
- No screens 1 hour before sleep
- Wake up at the same time daily

## Constipation Management

**Immediate:**
- Fiber, fiber, fiber — vegetables, fruits, chia seeds, psyllium
- More water (hydration = bowel motility)
- Gentle movement (walking after meals helps)

**Ongoing:**
- Aim for 25-30g fiber daily
- Add chia seeds, flax seeds to smoothies/oatmeal
- Consider magnesium supplement if approved by doc

**Medication note:** If constipation is severe, talk to your doctor. Over-the-counter options exist but check first.

**The pattern:** All three of these are interconnected.

Better hydration → less nausea, less constipation  
More fiber → less constipation, more energy  
Better sleep → less fatigue

**Manage one, the others improve.**

**My suggestion:** Start with water (it's the easiest win) and add one thing at a time.

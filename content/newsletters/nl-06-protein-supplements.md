# Newsletter #6: Protein Supplements — What Works

Subject: Can't eat enough protein? Here's what actually helps 🥧

---

Reality of GLP-1: Some days, you simply won't be hungry enough to hit your protein goals from food alone.

That's where supplements help.

But: **Most protein supplements are garbage.** Sugary, overpriced, or just... not good.

Here's what actually works:

## What Works

**Whey Protein Isolate Powder**
- Clean, fast-absorbing, high-quality
- Add to smoothies, oatmeal, even coffee
- Mixes well, minimal taste issues
- 25g per scoop

**Casein Protein Powder**
- Slower-digesting than whey (stays in system longer)
- Good before bed or for extended satiety
- Mixes into thicker puddings/yogurts
- 20-25g per scoop

**Collagen Peptides**
- Not a complete protein source
- But: good for skin, joints, tendons (common GLP-1 complaints)
- Unflavored powder dissolves in anything
- 10g per scoop (as supplement, not replacement)

## What's Okay

**Pea/Rice Protein Blends**
- Plant-based option (if you're avoiding dairy)
- Mixable, decent taste
- Complete protein (when combined)
- 20-25g per scoop

**Protein Bars**
- Read labels carefully! Most are candy bars in disguise
- Look for: 15-20g protein, <5g sugar
- Quest Bars, Pure Protein, Built Bar (check sugar) are okay options
- Use as snack, not meal replacement

## What to Skip

**Pre-workout supplements**
- Stimulants can worsen nausea
- You don't need them unless you're a serious athlete

**Mass gainers**
- Too many carbs, not enough protein (ratio is wrong for your goals)

**Fancy proprietary blends**
- Underdosed protein, overpriced
- Stick to simple: whey, casein, collagen

**Quick usage guide:**
- **Smoothies:** Add a scoop to any recipe
- **Oatmeal/porridge:** Mix in protein powder
- **Yogurt:** Stir protein powder into Greek yogurt for protein pudding
- **Chia pudding:** Mix chia seeds + protein powder + milk, refrigerate overnight

The goal: **Hit your protein total with what works for your current appetite.**

Supplements are tools — not replacements, not magic. But when you need help? They're legitimate.

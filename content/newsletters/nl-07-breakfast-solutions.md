Morning nausea on GLP-1? Or just... not hungry that early?

Problem: Breakfast is crucial. But your body's got other ideas.

Here's how to bridge that gap.

## The "Small First" Strategy

**Eat SOMETHING within 1 hour of waking.** It doesn't have to be a full meal.

**Options:**
- 1 hard-boiled egg + coffee
- 2-3 oz Greek yogurt
- Protein shake (25g)
- Protein bar (15-20g protein, <5g sugar)
- Leftover protein from dinner night before

It's not about volume. It's about **starting the day with protein.**

## The Make-Ahead Solution

If mornings are rough, your solution might be: **don't cook fresh.**

- Hard-boil 6 eggs Sunday night → easy grab all week
- Overnight oats with protein powder (combine oats, protein powder, milk, refrigerate)
- Protein muffin recipe (bake Sunday, microwave in the morning)
- Greek yogurt containers (pre-portioned)

**Why this helps:** No decision-making required when you're struggling. Just grab and go.

## The "Eat Later" Approach

If you genuinely feel sick in the morning, try this:

1. Drink 1 glass of warm water upon waking
2. Wait 1 hour
3. Try the smallest protein option you have (half a yogurt, 1 egg)
4. If still nauseous: don't force it. Try again in an hour.

Sometimes nausea is worst in the first hour of waking. It lifts later. The second attempt often succeeds.

## The "Night Before" Protocol

If mornings continue to be a problem:

- Eat your "breakfast" protein late night (11pm-1am window)
- Your body uses it for overnight recovery and morning needs
- The "fasted until noon" strategy works for some but not everyone

You've got protein on board. You're not starving yourself.

---

**The non-negotiable:** Get protein onboard in the morning window (some definition of "morning").

**The flexible part:** How it actually happens, when, how much.

---

**Your body's not stubborn — it's just adjusting. Give it some protein when you're ready, give yourself some grace, and keep trying until you find what works.**

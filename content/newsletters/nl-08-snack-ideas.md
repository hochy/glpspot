# Newsletter #8: Snack Ideas

Subject: Not hungry? Here's what to eat anyway 👆

---

Contradiction of GLP-1: You're less hungry, but you *still* need snacks.

Why? Protein spacing. Spreading protein intake throughout the day supports muscle maintenance better than binging at one meal.

Here are snack options that respect your reduced appetite:

## Easy Protein Snacks (Under 200 calories)

**Greek Yogurt + Berries**
- 170g plain Greek yogurt
- 1/2 cup berries (optional or minimal)
- 15g protein

**Cottage Cheese**
- 1/2 cup low-fat cottage cheese
- Add black pepper or cucumber slices
- 14g protein

**Turkey or Chicken Rollups**
- 3-4 oz deli turkey or chicken breast (no nitrites if possible)
- Wrap around cucumber slices or cheese
- 20-25g protein

**Hard-Boiled Eggs**
- 2 hard-boiled eggs
- Add pinch of salt/pepper
- 12g protein

**Protein Pudding**
- Mix 1 scoop casein or whey protein powder
- 100-150ml milk or water

**String Cheese + Almonds**
- 2 string cheese sticks
- 8-10 raw almonds

## "Not Hungry At All" Options

**Protein Shake — The Half-Portion**
- Make a full protein shake, but drink only half
- 12-13g protein vs. forcing more than your body wants

**Single Scoop Straight**
- Mix protein powder + water
- No fruit, no milk alternative, nothing extra
- 25g protein
- Quick, minimal

**Protein Bar — Split It**
- One protein bar, half now, half later
- 10-12g protein per half
- Spreads intake without forcing volume

## When to Snack

**Every 3-4 hours** is a good rule of thumb:

- **6am:** Eat breakfast (whatever you can manage)
- **10am:** Protein snack
- **1pm:** Lunch
- **4pm:** Protein snack
- **7pm:** Dinner
- **10pm:** Optional: small protein before bed

**Why this works:** Keeps protein flowing to muscles without requiring big, overwhelming meals.

## The "Eating Because I Should" Problem

Sometimes you just... don't want to eat.

**Solution:** Smallest protein option you can tolerate.

- 1 oz cheese (7g protein)
- 1 hard-boiled egg (6g protein)
- 1/2 cup cottage cheese (7g protein)

**Something is better than nothing.** Even 7g protein is protein.

**The goal isn't big snacks or elaborate foods. It's consistent, manageable protein intake.**

Take the path of least resistance. Your body doesn't care HOW the protein gets there — as long as it does.

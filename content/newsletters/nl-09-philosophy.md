# Newsletter #9: The GLPSpot Philosophy

Subject: This isn't a diet — here's what it is instead 🧠

---

The GLPSpot isn't a diet plan. It's not a 30-day challenge. It's not about restriction.

Here's what it **is**:

## Principle #1: Protein First

Every meal starts with: **"Where's the protein?"**

Breakfast → Eggs, yogurt, smoothie: Protein first, then decide what else you might want.

Restaurant → "What's the protein option?" Check menu, ask about modifications, choose smart.

Snack → "Is there protein?" If not, find alternative.

**Protein doesn't just maintain muscle** — it satisfies. When you eat enough protein, you feel full longer and need less volume overall.

## Principle #2: Work With Your Appeti

GLP-1 medications reduce your appetite. That's the point.

**Don't fight it.**

- Eat when you're hungry
- Don't finish just because "that's how much I usually eat"
- Stop when you feel done — not when plate is clean
- Save leftovers instead of forcing it down

**This isn't "restriction."** It's listening to your body's new normal.

## Principle #3: Small Portions Work

GLP-1 has taught us what we always suspected but ignored:

**You can be satisfied with less food.**

What felt "normal" before? Often too much.

What feels "enough" now? Less than before — but enough.

The smaller portions you're eating now? They're probably the right portions have always been.

## Principle #4: Avoid Deprivation

No food groups are "off limits." No foods are "bad."

You just eat less of some things and more of other things.

**Prioritizing protein = eating more of what your body needs.**

Not "never eat carbs." Not "no fruits." Not "no sweets ever."

**Eating WITHIN your reduced appetite.**

## Principle #5: Flexibility Over Rigidity

Meal timing isn't set in stone. Portions vary by day. Some days you'll hit all your goals, some days you won't.

**That's okay.**

Consistency matters more than perfection.

Weeks matter more than days. Months matter more than weeks.

## The Core Message

**The GLPSpot philosophy:**

> "Eat enough protein every day. Listen to what your body tells you (full = stop). Work with your appetite, not against it. Allow yourself to discover what 'enough' actually means."

Simple. No rules, no guilt, no shame.

Just practical guidance that respects where you are right now.

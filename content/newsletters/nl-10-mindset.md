# Newsletter #10: Your Body's Changing — That's Okay

Subject: The mental game of weight loss on GLP-1 💭

---

We've covered the practical stuff: Protein, water, restaurants, side effects.

Now let's talk about the **mental game.**

## The "I Have No Body Image" Surprise

Something that catches people off guard:

**The weight comes off fast on GLP-1.** Your mind doesn't adjust as quickly as your body does.

**You see a different size in the mirror. Your brain still expects the old one.**

This is normal. This is expected. This... passes.

Give it time. Your brain catches up to your body eventually.

## The "Food = Love" Confusion

Most of us have emotional connections to food:
- Comfort when stressed
- Celebration
- Bonding with friends
- Habit

On GLP-1, these patterns break. You're eating less, so old connections feel... different.

**You might feel:**
- Less comfort from food (because you're eating less)
- Less excited celebrating with food
- Less connected to people through shared meals

**This isn't a problem.** This is an opportunity.

Your relationship with food is becoming what it probably should have always been:食物是食物，不是药物。

It took years to develop those patterns. Unlearning them takes time. Be patient with yourself.

## The "I Feel Less Like Me" Feeling

Some people on GLP-1 feel:
- Less energetic (even if they're objectively healthier)
- Less present in social situations involving food
- Less sure of their identity

**Reality check:** You're not "less like yourself." You're the YOU without the overeating. Without the food distraction.

That's different. But different isn't worse.

The core of who you are — your values, your humor, your relationships, your purpose — none of that has changed.

You're the same person making different choices about food.

## The "I'll Put It Back On" Anxiety

Common fear: "If I stop the medication, I'll gain it all back."

Reality: Maybe. Maybe not.

**But focusing on that anxiety instead of enjoying who you are NOW? That's not serving you.**

Cross that bridge when/if you get there.

The healthier behavior patterns you're building now — protein first, eating less, portion awareness — those can transfer to your post-medication life if and when that day comes.

**Don't let future anxiety ruin present happiness.**

## The Bottom Line

**GLP-1 medications are a tool, not a personality.**

You're not losing yourself by taking them. You're gaining a different relationship with food, your body, and appetite.

That relationship can be healthier.

That's a win.

Be kind to yourself during this transition. You're not required to have it all figured out.

**Progress, not perfection. Always.**

To your health,
